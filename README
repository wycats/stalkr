Step 1:   Generate a new merb application
Step 2:   Run 'thor merb:gem:install' to bundle the stack gems
Step 3:   Generate a resource using "merb-gen resource article 'title:string, body:text'"
Step 4:   Added timestamps to Article <timestamps :at>
Step 5:   Automigrate the database "rake db:automigrate"
Step 6:   Add dm-sweatshop to dependencies.rb and run 'thor merb:gem:install'
Step 7:   Generate some bootstrap articles using dm-sweatshop (run "rake bootstrap" afterward)
Step 8:   Modify articles/index.html to list the generated articles
Step 9:   Modify config/router.rb to point "/" to Articles#index
Step 10:  Create a link to the article resource from articles/index.html
Step 11:  Modify articles/show.html to show a single article, and add a "Back" link back to the index
Step 12:  Modify articles/new.html to allow creation of a new article
NOTE:     If we create a new article smaller than 150 characters, the "... more link does not display", so...
Step 13:  Add a new helper to global_helpers.rb to handle more cases
Step 14:  Add the message[:notice] to the layout, to display "Article was successfully created"
Step 15:  Add delete link and delete confirmation
Step 16:  Modify articles/edit.html to allow editing of existing article
Step 17:  Reorganize articles spec into separate files (it's getting too big!)
Step 18:  Add validations to the article model, and test them
NOTE:     The String column for :title automatically validates at 50 characters
Step 19:  Inform the user why their creation or update failed validations
Step 20:  Generate the comments model using "merb-gen resource article 'body:text, author:string'"
