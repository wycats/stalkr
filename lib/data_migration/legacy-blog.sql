Yea, I think my problem is because I am trying to bootstrap everything inside my projects using thor instead of trying to keep the edge gems up to date on my system.  So in fact, when I install the merb auth (edge) gem on my system level, it fixes the problem.  But when I try and rely only on the merb-auth gems in my project gems directory, I get the following:\r\n\r\n$ ./bin/merb\r\n...\r\n ~ Loaded DEVELOPMENT Environment...\r\n ~ \r\n ~ FATAL: The gem merb-auth (= 0.9.10, runtime), [] was not found\r\n ~ \r\n ~ FATAL: The file merb-auth was not found\r\n ~ \r\n\r\nSo I suspect that the problem is that project level meta gems are not loading properly.  I am also seeing the same behavior with the merb-datamapper gem.  These are the only gems that are failing for me on a bootstrapped project.

Science and innovation goes forward not simply by trusting, but by asking the hard questions and not giving up until the difficult answers are found.\r\n\r\nRegarding people saying we need competition... well, that\'s true, in a selfish culture and society where everyone is looking out for themselves only (which is most of the business world, and many political circles, and is core to human nature to some extent), then the friction of everyone pulling against each other makes them pull harder and do greater things.  However, in a more altruistic culture (which includes some open source communities) cooperation can actually accomplish a lot more than competition ever could, because you\'re not wasting energy pulling against someone else, but pulling with them, everyone together to reach common goals together.  It\'s a doubling of effort, instead of duplication.  Of course that assumes the cooperation actually *works* and isn\'t broken down by some sort of internal struggles (personality clashes, personal selfishness, egos, laziness, lack of ability, lack of vision, getting stuck in a rut and comfortable with tradition, insecure or misguided leadership, etc).  If any of that happens then competition will be back soon enough to shake things up, I\'m sure.  I\'ve also found that competition with myself (trying to out-do myself) can be just as good of a personal motivator as trying to out-do anyone else, if I approach it with the right mind set, and this can allow me to cooperate with other people too at the same time instead of compete against them.

I was looking forwrd to getting started with Merb only to fail right at the starting gate. The fact that Merb wasn\'t giving me any warnings or logging any errors didn\'t help my mood. Neither was any help forthcoming from #merb. \r\nNext day, again without help, I started again and tried to track what it might be. I now believe that it may be a problem with my system and mongrel. Versions = 1.1.1 don\'t.  I have filed a bug with Mongrel Trac and pointed out which part of the changeset seems to be to the cause. \r\nI\'m a client side developer rather than a software engineer but persevered despite receiving little to no help. \r\nToday I feel like Ruby development community has some great teachers (D.Black, Yehuda, J.E.G II..) but is in desperate need of some helpful doctors.\r\n\r\nrarepleasures',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092414 Firefox/3.0.3','',0,0),(103,178,'Michael Klishin','michael@novemberain.com','http://novemberain.com','77.122.40.177','2008-10-17 08:12:41','2008-10-17 16:12:41','I wonder if Anthony has any significant contributions to tools and libraries he uses without paying a single penny.

I am also probably ruby\'s strongest advocate at the BBC.\r\nAlso, since I regularly buy peepcode screencasts, pragmatic pdfs, why\'s t-shirts and have dropped money in the tip jars of bloggers whose articles I\'ve found helpful, I think I can justifibly say I\'ve put a few pennies the communities way.\r\n\r\nI believe Rails owes much of its success to the fact you can be a consumer initially and enjoy using it so much that you want to give back in what ever way you can. \r\n\r\nIf there does turn out to be a bug in Mongrel,  Merb could choose some other webserver as its default with a msg on how to activate Mongrel, as Rails used to.

But the it seems clear to me that a lot of dedicated merb developers are getting the shaft by some very self-serving interests (Engine Yard VC\'s, book marketing, etc)...  At the end of the day, this may very well be about the ego\'s on top trying to grab a piece of the \"I built it, it\'s mine\" spotlight at the expense of the hundreds of dedicated unnamed developers that contributed thousands of hours to make things better.

Just having merb around makes rails better, so why merge? The frameworks were complimentary in many ways, so why not tolerate one another, and learn from one another but keep the frameworks seperate? Time would always tell if there\'s too little space for two great frameworks. I think that merb would have had a great future as an independent framework. I think that its technical improvements over rails would have opened many doors in the long run, and rails itself would have benefitted from the extra competition.\r\n\r\nCheers!',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_6; en-gb) AppleWebKit/525.27.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.2.1 Safari/525.27.1','',0,0),(399,382,'Arjun','ghosh.arjun@gmail.com','http://arjunghosh.wordpress.com/','122.160.202.235','2008-12-24 05:53:46','2008-12-24 13:53:46','This is definitely a good move!!!

I want to believe it\'s mainly because of merb\'s success.

I\'m really not sure how to read this. If you mean software developers in general, then I\'d say that\'s definitely and obviously not true. If you mean web developers, then that\'s really sad, and I\'d like to believe that it isn\'t true. I also don\'t really like the distinction. Web developers should be as rigorous in their design as those who develop for other platforms- the medium should not dictate quality, good design is good design regardless of platform. For any developer (web or otherwise) that doesn\'t have some kind of cursory familiarity with the Design Patterns book (even though MVC isn\'t actually in the GoF book), I\'d recommend it before I\'d recommend any book presenting a particular language. (Sorry Yehuda, I\'d even recommend it, and other books like it, before the books on Merb, or even the pick-axe, though that\'s not meant in any way to diminish your writing, just basic priorities.)\r\n\r\nI think we can all agree that the API Soup that was PHP when it first started invites poorly written code and attracts undereducated developers who won\'t be forced to actually design their project until after its become a large sprawling mess, and for that, I give a lot of thanks to Rails and other such frameworks (even Java\'s Spring framework, in all its configuratory glory). I\'m glad that Rails made a few people learn how to design a bit before they jump into the code, and so to that point, I agree with you. (I also wish that more Rails developers would actually *learn* MVC instead of just stumble around blindly trying to bend Rails to their will, but that\'s neither here nor there.) Maybe you were just overeager to credit Rails for increasing MVC- and pattern-awareness, though personally I\'d hardly go so far as to say that most developers wouldn\'t know MVC were it not for Rails.\r\n\r\nIt\'ll be nice when the drama of Rails vs. Merb is a non-issue. I know you\'re trying to put the issue to bed, and this hasn\'t been the first time you\'ve written about this issue. I\'m not sure if blogging about it more helps, or perpetuates, the issue, but if you guys can get on the same page with people like lifo, we might just end up being one big happy Ruby community.

Engine Yard doesn\'t make any decision on what Merb should do and how to do it. However, we do value Tom and Ezra\'s advise because they are experts in their domain and it would be foolish not to. Therefore, it\'s true to say that they both do influence Merb.\r\n \r\nMerb\'s lead developer is Yehuda Katz, who\'s also an Engine Yard employee. Maybe that\'s the confusing part. We might be used to companies like Microsoft which have a reputation of dictating. In this case, EY never forced anything on the Merb team.\r\n\r\nYour statement about Tom/Eza does not sound fully accurate to me. Few months ago, during one of his talks, Ezra was saying that Rails was faster to get up and running but if you were spending a bit longer setting up you will get more flexibility in the long term using Merb (sounds like they are competitors to me).\r\nNote that his comment was made before Merb Stack was finished.  In reality, both Merb and Rails are web framework and with Merb Stack, you can do exactly what you would do with Rails. So it\'s a bit hard to still say that merb is not a rails competitor.\r\n\r\nHowever, Merb offers a different approach to web development, you can have a 1 file app \"a la Sinatra\", a tiny framework with the bare minimum or a full fledged web framework \"a la Rails\". Having the luxury of easily and reliably pick and choose what components you need makes Merb totally different from Rails. That\'s maybe what you took as a disagreement since people might have commented on different aspect of the framework.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.',0,'1','Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4','',0,1),(246,245,'Peter Szinek','peter@rubyrailways.com','http://www.rubyrailways.com','195.168.241.15','2008-11-16 12:06:31','2008-11-16 20:06:31','Thanks for the clarification, Matt.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I guess I left out a few IMHOs.

Hanging the Merb flag on the Rails ship flies in the face of this basic principal.\r\n\r\nMy suspicion turns to the fact that almost every Merb core team member is owned by Engine Yard.

However, in all honestly even though we do everything we can to serve the community, it\'s still up to the core team to decide what we want to work on and how we want to do it.\r\nWe did expect that few people would not see things the same way we did.

There was so much promotion of pushing Merb as another choice and how great the future is of Merb - by itself. Then, in a matter of a week or less, with the same talking going on, the community is now told Merb is merging into Rails - removing Merb as the alternative. \r\n\r\nMany people in the community, including myself, have written patches and contributed to Merb. We\'ve sold the idea as it was sold to us. Now the idea will fade away, as it is. \r\n\r\nDismissing these feelings and emotions as being \"emo\" - as did some of the core team in #merb - shows a lack of caring for those who [the community] actually made Merb popular - the community got behind it.\r\n\r\nOne day Merb Core is telling everyone that Merb is the alternative, with a differently philosophy and goals. The very next day - from the eyes of the community - the community is told that really Merb has the same goal and ideas as Rails and, in fact, they are merging. \r\n\r\nNow, from my point of view, something changed. Either what the Merb Core team told everyone was a lie and Merb was really intended to be Rails, the idea of being a Rails Core Team member was too attractive, money or fame was involved, or the Merb Core sold out. I doubt it was being on the rails core team or money/fame - that leaves me with two choices, from my point of view and I doubt I\'m the only one that sees it that way.\r\n\r\nEither way, I feel the community was sold out by the Merb Core team. We bought your ideologies, we sold them, we helped build Merb and contribute to it, only to have, as Luke stated, the rug pulled out from under us. \r\n\r\nI\'m sure Rails 3.0 will be great, and my post here isn\'t really about how the \"code\" will be, but rather the politics that went on. Also, this isn\'t anger, but rather disappointment.

If you need the modularity and performance, the go with Merb, if you want a stable, full stack experience, go with rails.\r\n\r\n\"What is going to be easier, a transition from Merb 2.0 to Rails 3.0 or from Rails 2.x to Rails 3.0?\"\r\nIt should be easy in both situation.

The very next day - from the eyes of the community - the community is told that really Merb has the same goal and ideas as Rails and, in fact, they are merging.\"\r\n\r\nMerb did not change its view philosophy and goals.

What I was saying didn\'t have anything to do with Rails specifically. It was more about how the Merb Team decided, without the community, to merge with Rails. Merb has always been \"the community\" framework while Rails had been known to be DHH\'s framework. Nothing is wrong with either, it\'s just how it was and yes, I know Rails has become more than just a framework to scratch DHH\'s itch. \r\n\r\nI\'ve had a few opportunities to talk with David and my overall impression has always been that if you can convince him that something is better than he is all for it. It wasn\'t something that just radically changed in the last few months nor is it anything different then how most of us are. So, as I said, it\'s not that I don\'t think DHH or Rails cannot be convinced that something might be better, it was just how Merb made such a sudden shift (less than a week) from talking about Merb\'s future, 2.0, better/different than Rails (which it pride itself on) to signing kumbaja together. In that timeframe, the merb community, the ones who have been there since 0.3 or earlier, were left.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I\'m over it.

The only problem was that you still had to install merb-freezer on your server and it had to stay in sync with your app... kinda lame :(\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"240\" caption=\"Ginger roots, great for deployment issues\"]<a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/vieuxbandit/1987820964/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"illustration\" title=\"Ginger\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2373/1987820964_bc54df0d81_m.jpg\" alt=\"Ginger\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nInstead, after a lot of discussions, we decided to add this feature to merb-core and let you bundle all your dependencies in a bundled gem folder.

When you test your bundled app locally, you might endup loading system wide gems available which you don\'t have on your deployment server.\r\n\r\nIf when you deploy your app everything seems fine but you can\'t access your app, check that you are recompiling native gems during your deployment and make sure you have bundled all the deps you need and that they work well alone.\r\n\r\nOne more advise, if you can\'t figure out what\'s going, try ssh\'ing to your server, go to your current folder and try bin/merb -iÂ  to see what\'s going on.','Deploying a bundled merb app (merb 0.9.7+)',0,'','publish','open','open','','deploying-a-bundled-merb-app-merb-097','','','2008-09-23 15:32:41','2008-09-23 23:32:41','',0,'http://merbist.com/?p=23',0,'post','',8),(36,1,'2008-09-24 08:47:24','2008-09-24 16:47:24','Dear Merbivores/Merbists/Merbians,\r\n\r\nIt\'s hard to believe that in <a title=\"merbcamp\" href=\"http://merbcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\">less that 20 days</a>, Merb 1.0 will be released!

I\'m planning on writingi few articles about what I particularily like with DM and some of the misconceptions.\r\n\r\nI\'m going to give a talk about DataMapper during <a title=\"MerbCamp\" href=\"http://merbcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\">MerbCamp</a> and something I want to cover is the fact that you can write DM adapters for virtually anything. From an adapter for couchdb (available in dm-more) to an <a title=\"salesforce adapter\" href=\"http://github.com/wycats/dm-adapters/tree/master/salesforce\" target=\"_blank\">adapter for SalesForce API</a>. That\'s the kind of stuff that gets me excited, a bit like what <a title=\"Ambition\" href=\"http://ambition.rubyforge.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ambition</a> does but built-in in DM.\r\n\r\nSo, I decided to take some advise from <a title=\"Yehuda Katz\" href=\"http://yehudakatz.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Yehuda</a> and dkubb and wrote my own adapter for <a title=\"Google Video\" href=\"http://video.google.com\" target=\"_blank\">Google Video</a>. I had just finished a <a title=\"Gvideo\" href=\"http://github.com/mattetti/gvideo\" target=\"_blank\">gem to retrieve google videos</a> for a given google user and thought it would be a perfect exercise to mix a <a title=\"scraper\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_scraping\" target=\"_blank\">http-scraper</a> with a DM adapter.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nBased on the advise I received, I started by defining the API I want to use:\r\n<div class=\"code\"><script src=\"http://gist.github.com/13571.js\"></script></div>\r\nI matched the API calls to the underlying methods I would need to make. I then modified my original gem to support conditional calls.\r\n\r\nOnce that was done I implemented the required methods for my models to support the Model.first and Model.all calls with conditions.\r\n\r\nA custom adapter inherits from<span class=\"no\"> <a title=\"AbstractAdapter\" href=\"http://github.com/sam/dm-core/tree/master/lib/dm-core/adapters/abstract_adapter.rb\" target=\"_blank\">AbstractAdapter</a></span> and can define the default adapter methods:\r\n<pre>\r\n<div id=\"LC9\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">create</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">resources</span><span class=\"p\">)</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC10\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">raise</span> <span class=\"no\">NotImplementedError</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC11\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">end</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC13\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">read_many</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">query</span><span class=\"p\">)</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC14\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">raise</span> <span class=\"no\">NotImplementedError</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC15\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">end</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC17\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">read_one</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">query</span><span class=\"p\">)</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC18\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">raise</span> <span class=\"no\">NotImplementedError</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC19\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">end</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC21\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">update</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">attributes</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">query</span><span class=\"p\">)</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC22\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">raise</span> <span class=\"no\">NotImplementedError</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC23\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">end</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC25\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">def</span> <span class=\"nf\">delete</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">query</span><span class=\"p\">)</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC26\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">raise</span> <span class=\"no\">NotImplementedError</span></div>\r\n<div id=\"LC27\" class=\"line\">Â Â Â Â Â Â <span class=\"k\">end\r\n</span></div></pre>\r\nSince my adapter only needs to read data, I just had to implement #read_one and #read_many. I implemented a #read private method accessed by #read_one and #read_many as you can see <a title=\"implementation\" href=\"http://github.com/mattetti/dm-gvideo-adapter/tree/master/lib/dm-gvideo-adapter.rb#L29-60\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nBecause DM offers a clean and consistent API, things were pretty easy and you can check the <a title=\"specs\" href=\"http://github.com/mattetti/dm-gvideo-adapter/tree/master/spec/dm-gvideo-adapter_spec.rb\" target=\"_blank\">specs</a> to have a better understanding of how things are expected to work.\r\n\r\nAs you can see with less than 80LOC, I implemented an adapter that I can use and reuse cleanly in my apps. And on top of that, the adapter uses a standard API known by everyone using DM.\r\n\r\n<strong>Even though, this adapter has a very limited scope, I hope this example will inspire you and at your turn, will write some more cool adapters to share with the rest of us.</strong>\r\n<h2>UPDATE:</h2>\r\nSam Smoot, also known as Mr DataMapper made a very good comment. I should explain a bit more how you create a collection of objects to return when a user does a .all or .first call.\r\n\r\nThe whole collection creation is a bit strange at first.\r\n\r\nIn my read method, \"set\" is a DataMapper::Collection instance that is passed by the #read_one or #read_many method.\r\n\r\nThe collection needs to be loaded with an array of ordered params.\r\n\r\nFor instance in this case, to create a Video collection I need to load the collection with an ordered array of params like docid, title etc..Â  However, some params might be lazy loaded and in some instance, the query might be in the form of Video.all(:fields =&gt; :title)\r\n\r\nTo figure out what fields/params we need, I used:\r\n<pre><span class=\"n\">properties</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">query</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">fields\r\n</span></pre>\r\nWhich retrieves the required fields. Once you have the fields you need to return the structured data and that\'s when I used the #result_values method which basically loop through the fields and retrieves the data by sending the param as a method to the result:\r\n<pre><span class=\"n\">properties</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">map</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"o\">|</span><span class=\"nb\">p</span><span class=\"o\">|</span> <span class=\"n\">result</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">send</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\">p</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">field</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">repository_name</span><span class=\"p\">))</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span></pre>\r\nThe values once retrieved get loaded, but here is a trick I took from wycat\'s saleforce API:\r\n<pre><span class=\"n\">arr</span> <span class=\"p\">?</span> <span class=\"n\">set</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">load</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">values</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">break</span> <span class=\"n\">set</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">load</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">values</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">query</span><span class=\"p\">))\r\n</span></pre>\r\nThis snippet is quite simple if we set arr as true, that means we want to return an array so we will keep on looping (used by read_more when we want to return an array of objects). Otherwise we use the break operator which will stop the loop but also return a value. (yes, Ruby is awesome). By returning a single object we do exactly what\'s expected and don\'t have to call #first on a returned array.

Before getting started, you should know that not everything has been ironed out yet so don\'t expect to have a fully stable Edge.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started requires that you have <a title=\"Git\" href=\"http://git.or.cz/\" target=\"_blank\">git</a> installed as well as a gem called <a title=\"thor\" href=\"http://github.com/wycats/thor/tree/master\" target=\"_blank\">thor</a>.\r\n\r\nI let you take care of installing git on your machine, Ruby dev without git became quite challenging since <a title=\"GitHub\" href=\"http://github.com\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a> started ruling the Ruby OSS world.\r\n<pre><code class=\"shell\">sudo gem install wycats-thor -s http://gems.github.com</code></pre>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"240\" caption=\"Hops, used primarily as a flavoring and stability agent in beer, and also in other beverages and in herbal medicine.\"]<a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/fturmog/1438235253/\"><img title=\"Hops\" src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1418/1438235253_5b10c24732_m.jpg\" alt=\"Hops, used primarily as a flavoring and stability agent in beer, and also in other beverages and in herbal medicine.\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<a title=\"thor\" href=\"http://yehudakatz.com/2008/05/12/by-thors-hammer/\" target=\"_blank\">Thor</a> is a sort if mix between rake, <a title=\"sake\" href=\"http://errtheblog.com/posts/60-sake-bomb\" target=\"_blank\">sake</a> with a better argument parser and based on Ruby classes.\r\n\r\nThor on its own won\'t be very helpful, we need some thor tasks.\r\n\r\nCreate a folder where you want to store Merb\'s source code and cd in it.\r\n\r\nOnce there download the latest merb thor tasks:\r\n<pre><code class=\"shell\">curl -L http://merbivore.com/merb.thor &gt; merb.thor\r\n</code></pre>\r\nYou can now look at the available task by doing\r\n<pre><code class=\"shell\">thor -T</code></pre>\r\n<!--more-->\r\nAt this point you be overwhelmed by the multitude of options, we are working on making things a be nicer for 1.0.

You now have the latest version of Merb\'s libs installed locally as gems.\r\n\r\nYou might also want to install Merb extra plugins, if that\'s the case do:\r\n<pre><code class=\"shell\"> sudo thor merb:edge:plugins --install</code></pre>\r\nIf you decided to use DataMapper instead of ActiveRecord or Sequel, you will also need to install the gems you might need:\r\n\r\nInstall data_objects and an adapter: (replace mysql by the adapter you want to install)\r\n<pre><code class=\"shell\"> sudo thor merb:edge:do mysql --install</code></pre>\r\nInstall DataMapper core from Git HEAD\r\n<pre><code class=\"shell\"> sudo thor merb:edge:dm_core --install</code></pre>\r\nInstall DataMapper more from Git HEAD\r\n<pre><code class=\"shell\"> sudo thor merb:edge:dm_more --install</code></pre>\r\nYou should be all setup by now.\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\nNext time you want to update, just come back to the same folder and do the same thing.

The reason is that we made some changes to the config/environments/development.rb file few weeks ago and people did not notice. <a title=\"development.rb\" href=\"http://github.com/wycats/merb-more/tree/master/merb-gen/lib/generators/templates/application/merb/config/environments/development.rb\" target=\"_blank\">Here is</a> the new generated <a title=\"development.rb\" href=\"http://github.com/wycats/merb-more/tree/master/merb-gen/lib/generators/templates/application/merb/config/environments/development.rb\" target=\"_blank\">development.rb</a> file.

We were hoping to release Merb 1.0 final during <a title=\"MerbCamp\" href=\"http://merbcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\">MerbCamp</a> next week end. Unfortunately it looks like we will only release 1.0RC.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind this choice is simple, we have been adding a lot of features, fixed a lot of bugs and stabilized the API. However we need more feedback from users to be confident enough to release a final 1.0 release.','Few changes in Merb Edge',0,'','publish','open','open','','few-changes-in-merb-edge','','','2008-10-05 21:48:24','2008-10-06 05:48:24','',0,'http://merbist.com/?p=124',0,'post','',4),(134,1,'2008-10-06 20:50:15','2008-10-07 04:50:15','<ul>\r\n	<li>Mode changes to init.rb, user updating to a newer version or Merb will need to add\r\n<pre lang=\"ruby\">c[:log_file] = Merb.root / \"log\" / \"development.log\"</pre>\r\nto their init.rb file or config/environments/development.rb for instance. (Newly generated apps are already setup properly)</li>\r\n	<li>We made some changes to the way Rake files work. Merb-core doesn\'t require the rspec tasks anymore so Test::Unit see annoying rspec tasks. Once again people upgrading to the latest version of Merb need to make a small change and add:\r\n<pre lang=\"ruby\">require \'spec/rake/spectask\'</pre>\r\nto their rake file. Newly generated applications using RSpec already have that line setup.</li>\r\n	<li>In the last few days, <a href=\"http://yehudakatz.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Yehuda</a> merged in his branch with the new \"request-testing feature\". This is a new way of testing your apps. It makes testing a real request going through a controller and being rendered in a view, something quite easy, Merb interegration tests here we go!. <a href=\"http://gist.github.com/14910\" target=\"_blank\">Check here</a> to see a example of what you can now do. Rails + Rspec users might be surprised by this choice, and I\'ve scheduled to interview Yehuda so he can explain why and when you want to use this way of testing your app. (Don\'t miss his talk at <a href=\"http://merbcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\">MerbCamp</a> next week)</li>\r\n	<li>Talking about full stack testing, Merb is almost entirely full stack tested. What does that mean? Take a look at <a title=\"merb-helpers\" href=\"http://github.com/wycats/merb-more/tree/master/merb-helpers\" target=\"_blank\">merb-helpers</a> specs in <a title=\"merb-more\" href=\"http://github.com/wycats/merb-more\" target=\"_blank\">merb-more</a>. Form builders are tested through a real app available from spec/fixture/app, the views are rendered in the specs and the results are check to make sure they will work for you in your real application. Avoiding using too many mocks and stubs helped us really test things in the contet of a real app and avoid a great amount of ghost bugs. Specs might run a bit slower but we believe Merb now has better testing suite than before.

Yehuda then make sure all the commits are clean and merge them back in master (edge).\r\n\r\nReleases will have their own branches and tags.\r\n\r\nPeople wanting to hack on a specific feature should really fork a core member branch.

All the Ruby frameworks tested including Rails are way faster than PHP frameworks such as <a title=\"cakephp\" href=\"http://cakephp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CakePHP</a>, <a title=\"Symfony\" href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Symfony</a>, <a title=\"Code Igniter\" href=\"http://codeigniter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Code Igniter</a>.\r\n\r\nFibonacci type benchmarks seem to only test a certain aspect of a language, turns out that if you are interested in a fast and flexible web framwork, ruby and especially Merb are seriously the way to go.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: looks like someone posted a <a title=\"Keynote\" href=\"http://blip.tv/file/1354733\" target=\"_blank\">bootleg version of the keynote </a>;)','Merb 1.0 RC1',0,'','publish','open','open','','merb-10-rc1','','','2008-10-13 23:46:37','2008-10-14 07:46:37','',0,'http://merbist.com/?p=165',0,'post','',10),(172,1,'2008-10-16 11:15:27','2008-10-16 19:15:27','<a title=\"1.0 RC1\" href=\"http://merbist.com/2008/10/13/merb-10-rc1/\" target=\"_blank\">1.0RC1 was released</a> less than a week ago and we are already planning to release RC2 next week or so.\r\n\r\nThanks to all the contributors who reported RC1 bugs and submitted patches.

Some members of the .net community offered their help to compile windows native DM drivers. Supporting Windows is not an easy task but we think it is a critical thing to do.\r\n\r\nWe are also discussing setting up a nightly gem server so people could test Merb edge without having to use git etc..Â  It\'s also a great way for us to test gem dependencies before an official release. The only problem with nightly gems is that you need to have a way to track what version is being installed or what version a user reporting a bug is using. We do have some ideas, but please feel free to add a comment with your suggestions.\r\n\r\nOn a different note, the <a title=\"wiki\" href=\"http://wiki.merbivore.com/\" target=\"_blank\">new wiki</a> is growing nicely, but we do need more content, as you are experimenting with Merb 1.0RC, please think about sharing your knowledge with others by using the <a title=\"wiki\" href=\"http://wiki.merbivore.com/\" target=\"_blank\">wiki</a>.\r\n\r\nFinally, people on Edge are reporting issue with gems not loading properly. The problem is that you have generated an app with hardcoded dependencies (check your config/dependencies.rb file). Your app won\'t load newer gems and therefore migth crash. Make sure to define the proper dependencies. We are working onÂ  documenting this behavior and making the error message clearer.','Preparing Merb 1.0 RC2',0,'','publish','open','open','','preparing-merb-10-rc2','','\nhttp://merbist.com/2008/10/13/merb-10-rc1/','2008-10-16 11:15:27','2008-10-16 19:15:27','',0,'http://merbist.com/?p=172',0,'post','',6),(178,1,'2008-10-16 22:26:50','2008-10-17 06:26:50','I\'ve been following what people say on <a title=\"Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a> about <a title=\"Merb via twitter\" href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=merb\" target=\"_blank\">Merb</a>.\r\n\r\nI simply used <a title=\"Twitter\" href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=merb\" target=\"_blank\">twitter search engine</a>.\r\n\r\nBecause I only have a private twitter account I can\'t reply to everyone.\r\n<blockquote>freels: <a title=\"twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/freels/statuses/962887213\" target=\"_blank\">I keep expecting merb to have a view helper for random things...</a></blockquote>\r\n@freels, feel free to let us know about the view helpers you miss.

Engine Yard didn\'t yet announce the price structure but <strong>having the option for enterprise level support for Merb is just awesome</strong>.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Rails Tips\" href=\"http://railstips.org\" target=\"_blank\">John Nunemaker</a> made an interesting comment during RubyConf <a title=\"Pivotal labs\" href=\"http://pivotallabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pivotal</a> Party. Something special about Merb is that it was designed to fit the needs of an audience instead of trying to create a series of tools to build a specific type of website. Having Engine Yard help to finance Merb dev and offer support is very reassuring. It\'s something already done by many other OSS projects such as Ubuntu, MySQL etc...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ma-agile.com/training\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-207\" title=\"merb-training\" src=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/merb-training-small-238x300.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"238\" height=\"300\" /></a>The second announcement Yehuda made was about <a title=\"Merb Training\" href=\"http://ma-agile.com/training/\" target=\"_blank\">Merb Training</a>. I\'m probably pretty biased since I am at the origin of this project. I know for a fact that a lot of people were waiting for 1.0 to get started with Merb. We are also working on getting more documentation out, and 3 books are coming up. Still, the best way to learn is to sit down with people who know Merb who can teach you the way its intended to be used.\r\n\r\nTraining will allow you to benefit a lot from being with other people who also share the same desire to <strong>master Ruby\'s most powerful and flexible web framework</strong>.\r\n\r\nWhat\'s also really exciting is that <a href=\"http://yehudakatz.com\" target=\"_blank\">Yehuda Katz</a>, Merb\'s lead developer, agreed to be a tutor for the course. I can\'t imagine a better way to learn. Check <a title=\"Merb Training\" href=\"http://ma-agile.com/training/\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a> for more information about the next training session or get in contact with me if you want to organize a training session for your company.\r\n<h3>Finally, the <strong>big news was the announcement of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Merb 1.0</span></strong>!</h3>\r\nMerb 1.0 went through 5 release candidates and was finally marked as final. In the last few months, the Merb team worked hard to make things easier for people who want to get started in no time.\r\n\r\nLet\'s quickly look at why Merb is awesome:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Merb is Modular</strong>. Merb is not a monolithic framework. You can pick and choose what you need. Create a 1 file app \"Ã  la Sinatra\" or a rich web app \"Ã  la Rails\". Merb has many components. Only requires the ones you need and save precious resources. (Merb doesn\'t believe in 1 size fits all)</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Merb is agnostic</strong> (kinda). Because people have different needs and different believes, Merb won\'t force you to use one ORM or another. Same thing goes for the template engine or for the JavaScript library you want to use. ActiveRecord, DataMapper, Sequel, RelaxDb, Haml, Erb, Prototype, jQuery... choose which one you want and change whenever you want.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Merb <em>can</em> be opinionated</strong>. Merb offers a default stack using DataMapper and jQuery, authentication, exceptions and caching setup for you. However, creating your own stack is dead easy. As a matter of fact, the guys at <a title=\"YP\" href=\"http://yellowpages.com\" target=\"_blank\">yellowpages.com</a> are using Merb and were talking about creating their own stack using Sequel.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Merb let you reuse your code</strong>. Borrowed from <a title=\"Django\" href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Django</a>, Merb has something called \"slices\". Slices are mini apps you can run standalone or mounted within another app. A slice is a great way to write code you can reuse. Unlike plugins which extend the framework features, slices are a way to provide encapsulated content. (<a title=\"David Chelimsky\" href=\"http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/\" target=\"_blank\">David Chelimsky,</a> RSpec\'s author and maintainer actually said that slices where his favorite feature in Merb 1.0)</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Merb has an API</strong>. You might be wondering why having an API is awesome. Well, the truth is that the Merb Team spent time marking methods public, which are guaranteed to not break until the next major release (any change to the public API will be well documented). There is also a plugin API meaning that plugin developers won\'t have to worry about upgrades if they stick to the plugin API.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Merb is fast.</strong> Even though Ruby the language isn\'t really fast and contrary to popular opinion, Ruby for the web is one of the fastest solutions out there. (Even Rails is <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/wycats/merb-camp-keynote-presentation\" target=\"_blank\">way faster than all the mainstream PHP frameworks</a>) And that\'s what Merb is proving by being one of the fastest web framework available on the market. <a href=\"http://railsenvy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Seifer</a> will be interested to know that Merb isn\'t scared to scale ;) As a matter of fact, Merb is going to scale even better in the next few months as we are planning to integrate <a title=\"swiftiply\" href=\"http://swiftiply.swiftcore.org/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Swiftiply</a> and do some totally awesome stuff to spawn/reap workers based load. (more about that in few weeks).</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Matz likes Merb</strong>. Ruby\'s daddy, Yukihiro Matsumoto told us he likes the flexibility of Merb and the fact that the framework doesn\'t create a DSL on top of Ruby. He even told us that he\'s going to introduce his company to Merb! We were obviously very honored and for us, it validates months of work by dozens of contributors. Here is a transcript of Matz comments about Merb and the Ruby web world:\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_213\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"125\" caption=\"Yukihiro Matsumoto aka Matz\"]<a href=\"http://ruby-lang.org\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-213\" title=\"Yukihiro Matsumoto\" src=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/yukihiro_matsumoto_125px.jpg\" alt=\"Yukihiro Matsumoto aka Matz\" width=\"125\" height=\"186\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n<blockquote>\"Everyone outside of the Ruby community understands that we only have 1 web application framework, named Rails, but it\'s not true in any sense. We have several post-Rails frameworks, which is very good, and I believe in diversity.\r\n\r\nMerb has a bright future for the people who are not satisfied by the fixed ways in Rails.Â  I think that Merb will give users more freedom in a Ruby-ish way of programming.\r\n\r\nI\'m not really a web-guy, so i don\'t judge any of them [frameworks], but Rails does some kind of drastic change on the language itself like in Active Support.Â  But Ruby has its own culture and technological atmosphere in the language so that keeping that makes me feel easier.\"</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Merb is memory friendly and therefore cheap</strong>. Merb is Open Source and free, but hosting an application costs money. Merb memory footprint is tiny compared to other solutions and that means that hosting will cost you less. (interesting when you think that EngineYard help developing Merb :p) Using <a title=\"REE\" href=\"http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby Entreprise Edition</a>, you will even use less memory, meaning you save even more money ;) By the way, Matz told me this morning that the Ruby core team is working on their own solution for a better GC and it should be available soon. (Ruby 1.9.x)</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Merb source code is easy to read</strong>. Because <a href=\"http://github.com/wycats/merb/tree/master\" target=\"_blank\">Merb code</a> is modular and because Merb has a concept of an API, reading Merb\'s source code is pretty easy. On top of that, Merb itself uses RSpec making tests really easy to read and understand.Â  What\'s great when the source code is easy to read is that developers can quickly check the source code if they want to understand how things work. We also get better patches from contributors and we keep our code clean. We believe in the theory of the \"Broken Windows\" by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling:\r\n<blockquote>\"Consider a building with a few broken windows. If the windows are not repaired, the tendency is for vandals to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it\'s unoccupied, perhaps become squatters or light fires inside.\r\n\r\nOr consider a sidewalk. Some litter accumulates. Soon, more litter accumulates. Eventually, people even start leaving bags of trash from take-out restaurants there or breaking into cars.\"</blockquote>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI guess I could keep on going with other reasons why Merb is so awesome, but let\'s keep some for another post ;)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, on behalf of the Merb core team, I\'d like to thank all the Merb contributors, Ezra Zygmuntowic (creator of Merb), Yehuda Katz (Merb lead developer), Matz (Ruby creator) and finally DHH &amp; the Rails core team. One more thing:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n$ sudo gem install merb\r\n$ merb-gen app my-awesome-merb-app\r\n</code>','Merb 1.0 released',0,'','publish','open','open','','merb-1-0-released','','','2008-12-17 11:59:44','2008-12-17 19:59:44','',0,'http://merbist.com/?p=204',0,'post','',13),(228,1,'2008-11-14 00:39:27','2008-11-14 08:39:27','Â \r\n\r\nAs you must know by now, last week,<a title=\"Merb 1.0 released\" href=\"http://merbist.com/2008/11/09/merb-1-0-released\" target=\"_blank\"> Merb 1.0 got released</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/nsa_logo.gif\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-229\" title=\"nsa_logo\" src=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/nsa_logo.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"255\" height=\"256\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBecause we wanted to assure the release was fine, we asked <a title=\"engine yard\" href=\"http://engineyard.com\" target=\"_blank\">Engine Yard</a>, <a href=\"http://apple.com\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a> and <a href=\"http://yellowpages.com\" target=\"_blank\">YellowPages.com</a> to help us by hiring the NSA to monitor Merb users. After all, we need to know what people complain about so we can fix it ASAP.\r\n\r\nTurns out all the <a title=\"echelon\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON\" target=\"_blank\">echelon monitoring sites</a> were already busy. So we had to go back to good old IRC and <a title=\"twitter\" href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=merb\" target=\"_blank\">twitter search</a> ;)\r\n\r\nThe release looks pretty solid, thanks to all the people reported bugs during the release candidate cycle. Thanks guys!\r\n\r\nHowever there are still few points of confusion I\'d like to address.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<h2>How do I require/request/load a plugin?</h2>\r\nI saw this question few times on IRC and someone after my <a href=\"http://orug.org\" target=\"_blank\">ORUG</a> merb presentation tonight asked me exactly the same thing. I promised <a title=\"peepcode\" href=\"http://peepcode.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Geoffrey Grosenbach</a> that I would update the RDoc but in the meantime here is quick explanation.\r\n\r\nYou should almost never use the require method to load a gem. Rubygems has a method called gem that takes a version as an argument:\r\n\r\n<code> require \"rubygems\"\r\ngem \"merb-core\", \"~&gt; 1.0\"\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nUsing gem you can specify a version of the gem you want to load. Therefore you avoid loading an unexpected version of a gem. A few tricks to know (for regular Ruby code; keep reading for the Merb technique):\r\n\r\nYou can use \"=1.0\" to limit to version 1.0, or \"&gt;= 1.0\" to load 1.0 and anything newer. My favorite trick is to use \"~&gt; 1.0\" which means load latest version between 1.0 and 2.0\r\n\r\nHowever when using Merb you don\'t want to load gems just whenever. Merb\'s bootup process starts by setting up the directory structure, and you typically want to load plugins after this point. To make this transparent to you, we have the #dependency method. The dependency method uses the gem method internally to load specific versions at the right time. Additionally, we may use it in the future to improve Merb\'s built-in bundling or dependency resolution. As a result, you should always use the dependency method, and not try to use require directly for Merb plugins.\r\n\r\nIt also comes with two tricks you should know about. Let\'s say you want to require a gem from github:\r\n\r\n<code> dependency \"mattetti-awesomeâ€, \"~&gt;1.0\", :require_as =&gt; â€œawesomeâ€\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe example above is the same as:\r\n<code>\r\ngem \"mattetti-awesome\", \"~1.0\"\r\nrequire \"awesome\"\r\n</code>\r\nApart that it gets loaded when it\'s appropriate.\r\n\r\nYou can also pass a block after your dependency call:\r\n\r\n<code> dependency(\'jchris-couchrest\', \"&gt;= 0.5\", :require_as =&gt; \"couchrest\") do\r\nÂ Â require \"lib/custom_hack.rb\"\r\nendÂ </code>\r\n\r\nThe block will be executed after the gem is loaded and required. Use a block if you want to perform some action after the dependency is loaded.\r\n\r\nFinally the last trick lets you load a gem right when you declare the dependency:\r\n\r\n<code> dependency \"nokogiriâ€, \"~&gt;0.5\", :immediate =&gt; true</code>\r\n<h2>I have issues with merb -i and can\'t run the specs</h2>\r\nFew things here, first off, Merb forces you to use rubygems 1.3 because 1.2 is very buggy and the Rubygems maintainer suggested we do so. Rubygems let you define development-only dependencies, dependencies you don\'t need to have to run your library in production. These dependencies were designed to be used when developing a library, but in the case of Merb, they are used to define dependencies that you only need at development-time, but not in production.\r\n\r\nIn our case we defined webrat as a development dependency. That means you need Webrat to run your specs, but won\'t need it in production. Now here is something you should know, whenever you install a gem to develop it, you should use:\r\n\r\n<code>gem install \"merb-core\" --development\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe --development flag will install all the dev dependencies declared by the gem.  Now merb -i loads the code needed to make the request object available in the console, the problem is that this code also loads some test helpers which require webrat. We have a ticket open for that and will get to that soon.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, make sure you have webrat and nokogiri installed. (Nokogiri requires you have a somehow recent version of libxml2, which comes with OSX, but not all Linux distributions).\r\n\r\nPeople reported some issues updating rubygems, Robby Colvin wrote a <a href=\"http://robbycolvin.com/archives/merbrubygems-upgrade-errors/\" target=\"_blank\">nice article</a> explaining how to get pass this issue.\r\n<h2>Issues with action-args not loading</h2>\r\nSome people reported issues with loading action-args. Turns out it\'s some sort of weird issue with hoe (the library) and a some of action-args deps. If that happens to you, update hoe:<code>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<code>$ sudo gem install hoe\r\n</code>\r\n<h2>I generated an app and it doesn\'t work with JRuby</h2>\r\nIf you generate a merb using merb-gen app my-app-name it generates a merb stack app. It\'s an opinionated bundle with everything you might need including jQuery, DataMapper and a bunch of plugins. The problem is that DataMapper doesn\'t run on JRuby yet so it won\'t work.\r\n\r\nInstead you should generate a core application:\r\n\r\n<code>merb-gen core app-name</code>\r\n\r\nThis way you create a blank app with no dependencies. Then add what you need. <a href=\"http://wiki.merbivore.com/faqs/merb_components\" target=\"_blank\">Here is a list of dependencies</a> for a merb stack app and what they do.\r\n<h2>Thanks</h2>\r\nFinally I would like to thank the Ruby community from Japan. First because many people came to RubyConf all the way from Japan. I\'m personally sorry I couldn\'t meet you all. Thankfully some people started a new chat channel on lingr: <a title=\"Merb Japane\" href=\"http://www.lingr.com/room/merb.jp\" target=\"_blank\">merb.jp</a> and I could meet more Japanese Merbists. Because the Merb team thinks is important that Merb is being used outside of the English speaking world and because we need feedback from other countries, I decided to make the trip to RubyKaigi 2009.

Few weeks ago there was a tentative from Giles to create some controversy but he did not really work so well. The last big drama we had in the Ruby community was Zed and his infamous blog post...\r\n<h2>The plot</h2>\r\nOnce upon a time, in a world where .NET, JAVA and PHP were ruling the internet development world, a not so well known programming language was getting more and more traction in the far east. Ruby, as it was known in Japan, only had very little documentation in English and real ninjas had to translate docs from <em>obscure</em> Japanese writings in order to become enlightened. Nevertheless, a courageous Danish student named David decided to build an application called <a href=\"http://www.basecamphq.com/\" target=\"_blank\">basecamp</a> using this \"exotic\" language. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson\" target=\"_blank\">David</a> decided to extract a framework from his work for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/37_signals\" target=\"_blank\">37signals</a>. He called his framework \"<a href=\"http://rubyonrails.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby on Rails</a>\" and offered it to the world under the MIT license. Pretty quickly, as <a href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby</a> was getting more popular in the West, people looked at \"Rails\" and loved the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller\" target=\"_blank\">MVC architecture</a>, the conventions over configuration, testing framework and especially the language: <a href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby</a>.\r\n\r\nAs Rails was getting popular, a man from Polish descent known as <a href=\"http://brainspl.at/\" target=\"_blank\">Ezra Zygmuntowicz</a> and who was working for <a href=\"http://www.engineyard.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Engine Yard</a> got frustrated with some of Rails limitations. He needed something simpler, easier and faster. In fact he just needed a Mongrel handler, a way to process a request really quickly without going through then entire stack and without slowing down the main app. That\'s how Ezra started <a href=\"http://merbivore.com\" target=\"_blank\">Merb</a>.\r\n\r\nLet\'s fast forward 2 years. The year is 2008, the place is Orlando, Florida. <a href=\"http://yehudakatz.com\" target=\"_blank\">Yehuda Katz</a>, Merb\'s lead developer announces the 1.0 release of a Ruby web framework started 2 years earlier by Ezra. The framework\'s selling points are: performance, modularilty, flexibilty.Â  In the mean time other Ruby frameworks were developed such as <a href=\"https://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/\" target=\"_blank\">camping</a>, <a title=\"sinatra\" href=\"http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Sinatra</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mackframework.com/\" target=\"_blank\">mack</a>, <a href=\"http://rubywaves.com/\" target=\"_blank\">waves</a>...\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<h2>The plot twist</h2>\r\nNow that Merb 1.0 is out, some people want to know what they should use for their next project. Merb or Rails? What\'s the difference, after all they seem to be doing the same thing. Someone starts a <a title=\"reddit drama\" href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/7d5u6/so_why_should_i_choose_merb_over_ruby_on_rails/\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit thread</a> asking this very same question to the community.... and the drama begins!\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>part 1:</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSomeone mentions that <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/7d5u6/so_why_should_i_choose_merb_over_ruby_on_rails/c06ckgv\" target=\"_blank\">Merb has less code so it\'s easier to understand</a> the \"underpinnings of your framework\". <a href=\"http://bitsweat.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremy Kemper aka Bitsweat</a> from Rails core team reply by saying that <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/bitsweat/\" target=\"_blank\">Rails code base is only 1/4 bigger than Merb\'s</a>.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>part 2:</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYehuda Katz, jumps to his shell, runs some commands and <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/comments/7d5u6/so_why_should_i_choose_merb_over_ruby_on_rails/c06d0f3\" target=\"_blank\">replies that Jeremy</a> did not count right and really, Merb is half the code size has Rails. He even writes a <a href=\"http://yehudakatz.com/2008/11/14/mythbusting-merb-style/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post to explain what he did</a> his main point being that Merb can run on subset of his code (merb-core) while Rails can\'t.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>part 3:</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAt this point, DHH already <a href=\"http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/29-the-rails-myths\" target=\"_blank\">started addressing</a> some of the reproaches the Merb community has brought on Rails. Interesting enough, DHH carefully never mentions Merb though. However just after wycats/Yehuda\'s post, DHH releases a post entitled: <a href=\"http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/33-myth-4-rails-is-a-monolith\" target=\"_blank\">Rails is a monolith</a>. In his post, DHH calls LOC comparison an \"inverse dick measurement match\". He goes even further and gives the size of some of Rails\' components, mentions that there is a way in Rails to remove parts you don\'t want but that anyway \"Why would you bother? And that\'s an answer I [DHH] don\'t quite have for you.\"\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>part 4 (I told you it was a real drama)</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYehuda considers that even though, DHH didn\'t mention him or Merb, \"they\" means the Merb community. Unfortunately, DHH doesn\'t allow comments on his site so Yehuda decides to write yet <a href=\"http://yehudakatz.com/2008/11/15/mythbusting-rails-is-not-a-monolith/\" target=\"_blank\">another blog post</a>. In his post, Yehuda deconstructs DHH arguments and tries to explain the philosphical difference between the two frameworks.\r\n<h2>Drama or no drama?</h2>\r\nThere were a lot of comments on reddit and yehuda\'s blog, a lot of tweets were sent, Â but is there a real drama?\r\n\r\nMy answer is <strong>no</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Merb was developed because some people like Ezra, Yehuda, myself and others were frustrated by some aspects of the Rails framework. We believed in the framework main concept but we were not sharing some of the core values or some of the details of the implementation.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing but respect for DHH and the Rails core team.<strong> To be honest, without Matz and without DHH, I wouldn\'t do the job I do today and my job would probably not be as much as what it is</strong>. Most, if not all of the Merb core team members contributed to Rails and are very familiar with its architecture. We just have a different philosophy/approach of problems.\r\n\r\nThere is also a lot of collaboration between the two teams. Ezra brought rack to Rails, Merb pushed rails to become thread-safe, during RubyConf, <a href=\"http://joshpeek.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Peek</a> mentioned <a href=\"http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/programs/1/episodes/rubyconf-2008\" target=\"_blank\">porting run_later</a> (a Merb only feature) to Rails now that it\'s thread safe. On the other end, we based a lot of our framework on concepts proven by Rails.\r\n\r\n<strong>So what is it all about?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt\'s just people arguing ideas. It\'s actually a very healthy thing for a community to do.\r\n\r\nI\'m not oviously talking about the Rails overall community. I do realize it might shake the Rails community a little bit, but I think it\'s for the best.\r\n\r\nI also hope Sinatra, Waves, camping will join the debate. Sinatra for example is an awesome tiny framework. Merb has flat/very-flat structures which do something similar to Sinatra but with some differences. I think it\'s great we can talk freely about the philosophies behind each framework.\r\n\r\nBy putting arguments out there and arguing ideas without fighting, I strongly believe that each framework will just become better and it would be easier for developers to choose what framework fits their needs best.\r\n\r\n<strong>No drama then?</strong>\r\n\r\nWell, maybe a little bit, let me quote a quote from <a href=\"http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Have_an_Enemy.php\" target=\"_blank\">37signals book, getting real</a>:\r\n<blockquote><strong>Don\'t follow the leader</strong>\r\nMarketers (and all human beings) are well trained to follow the leader. The natural instinct is to figure out what\'s working for the competition and then try to outdo it â€” to be cheaper than your competitor who competes on price, or faster than the competitor who competes on speed. The problem is that once a consumer has bought someone else\'s story and believes that lie, <strong>persuading the consumer to switch is the same as persuading him to admit he was wrong</strong>. And people hate admitting that they\'re wrong.</blockquote>\r\nâ€”<a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Seth Godin</a>, author/entrepreneur (from <a href=\"http://www.moveahead1.com/articles/article_details.asp?id=33\" target=\"_blank\">Be a Better Liar</a>)\r\n\r\nGodin makes a good point, some people feel threatened by a new solution competing with the one they currently use. Godin and 37 signals suggest that instead of competing on the same ground as the leader (in this case Rails), you should position yourself differently and that\'s what Merb has been doing since theÂ beginning.\r\n\r\nThat\'s probably why Yehuda reacted when Jeremy and David said that basically, Merb was no different than Rails.\r\n\r\nMerb\'s point is not to be a faster Rails, instead Merb brings a different approach to the Ruby web development world. And that\'s the true identity of Merb.\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\nNo need for trolling or making a big deal about what happened. Rails and Merb are both lead by opinionated/passionate people who have a different view on what their framework should do and how it should do it. Â Let\'s keep the dialogue open but let\'s not forget that all of us spend hours and hours offering software and the goal is to server the community no to fight.\r\n\r\nBoth Rails and Merb have pros and cons, learn more about the difference between the two frameworks, look at other solutions and more importantly evaluate your needs.','Rails vs Merb Â¿drama?',0,'','publish','open','open','','rails-vs-merb-drama','','','2008-12-17 12:00:17','2008-12-17 20:00:17','',0,'http://merbist.com/?p=245',0,'post','',17),(270,1,'2008-11-16 21:35:44','2008-11-17 05:35:44','I\'ll try to keep the community posted on the latest merb news.

We looked at different benchmarks, discussed the philosophical differences between Merb and Rails, his own view of web development and how Ruby was perceived in Japan. Yehuda joined us and we started talking about Ruby 1.9.\r\n\r\nKoichi had a great presentation abou<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/notheory/3037535342/in/photostream\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"matz katz mattetti\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3046/3037535342_d35680909d_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"161\" /></a>t YARV few days before and we spent few hours chatting with the JRuby guys and Laurent Sansonetti from MacRuby. We had some concerns about Ruby 1.9, Matz also asked us about Ruby 1.8.7. It was great to get a direct feedback about what\'s going on in the Ruby team, their schedule, process etc... We also realized that we (the Merb team) need to communicate better with the Ruby team when we need something added the language. It was also very interesting to hear Matz\' opinion on Ruby Enterprise Edition.Â  As everybody knows Matz is a nice guy and that\'s why Ruby people should be nice :)Â  I have to agree, Matz is a very kind and patient person.\r\n<h2>Hack time with Aaron Patterson and Bryan Helmkamp</h2>\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"240\" caption=\"Yehuda (Merb), Charles (JRuby) and Laurent (MacRuby)\"]<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/notheory/3037534604/in/photostream/\"><img title=\"Yehuda, Charles, Laurent \" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3051/3037534604_fe74986020_m.jpg\" alt=\"Yehuda (Merb), Charles(JRuby) and Laurent(MacRuby)\" width=\"240\" height=\"161\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why RubyConf was awesome is that every other guy was the author/maintainer of a major Ruby library. As you know Merb plays well with a lot of various libraries and having some time to seat down with the maintenairs of these libraries make things way easier.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://tenderlovemaking.com/2008/10/30/nokogiri-is-released/\" target=\"_blank\">Nokogiri</a> As already mentioned, we switched to nokogiri before 1.0. Nokogiri is based on libxml2 which is a fast and reliable XML parser. I won\'t get into the hpricot vs nokogiri argument, but let\'s just say that nokogiri was fitting our needs better. (Nokogiri is only used in the specs, and therefore is not needed to run Merb)\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"240\" caption=\"David Chelimsky (RSpec), Matt Aimonetti (Merb)\"]<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/notheory/3036694117/\"><img title=\"david and matt\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3053/3036694117_13b53141d7_m.jpg\" alt=\"David Chelimsky(RSpec), Matt Aimonetti(Merb)\" width=\"240\" height=\"161\" /></a>[/caption]\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://github.com/brynary/webrat/tree/master\" target=\"_blank\">Webrat</a> is an awesome library that let you test your app by using a virtual browser or by integrating with <a href=\"http://selenium.seleniumhq.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Selenium</a>. Webrat also switched to Nokogiri and we moved some of our matchers directly to webrat since webrat became a Merb development dependency. Thanks to webrat you can write tests that will fill up forms, follow links, select options... basically act as a user. What\'s even better is that you can run these test directly in your browser thanks to Selenium!Â  Because we think Webrat is totally awesome, we decided to offer framework support so people wanting to use webrat functionalities could do it without struggling, it there out of the box.\r\n\r\nI have to say that both Bryan and Aaron are great guys, even though they both had their girlfriends with them, they spent time with us working out some details and discussion options. Thanks a lot guys!\r\n\r\n(p.s: both projects also work great with Rails)\r\n<h2>Merb presentation at ORUG</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://orug.org\" target=\"_blank\">Orlando Ruby Group</a> meets once a month and this month I was invited to talk about Merb.

It seems that Yehuda and David agree on something: <a href=\"http://yehudakatz.com/2008/11/16/mythbusting-we-agree-ruby-is-awesome/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby is awesome</a>. <a href=\"http://www.loudthinking.com/\" target=\"_blank\">David</a> is still ignoring Merb, but is answering indirectly via an interesting series of <a href=\"http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/29-the-rails-myths\" target=\"_blank\">Rails Myths</a>. Over on Twitter, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/adzap/statuses/1007999209\" target=\"_blank\">adzap suggests</a> that Yehuda was just following DHH advise, and was trying to create a conflict because, <a href=\"http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/conflict_is_good_for_business.php\" target=\"_blank\">according to 37signals conflict is good for business</a>. I don\'t think that\'s what Yehuda had in mind when he replied to Jeremy, but that would explain why DHH ignores <em>(Â¿on purprose?)</em> the Merb community.\r\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\r\nSince 1.0 is out, our main focus has been documentation. However we can\'t write all the documentation ourselves. So we focused on helping people on IRC/Mailing list so they can help us with the documentation. The Japanese merbists started their own wiki, the Chinese, French and Japanese merbists started their own mailing list. <a href=\"http://jijixi.azito.com/cgi-bin/diary/index.rb?date=20081112\" target=\"_blank\">Here is an example</a> of Japanese thread covering some of Merb basics.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://wiki.merbivore.com\" target=\"_blank\">wiki</a> is also growing, I personally added a glossary to the \"<a href=\"http://wiki.merbivore.com/faq_converting_a_rails_app_to_merb\" target=\"_blank\">Rails to Merb guide</a>\". Showing you the Merb equivalent of some of Rails idioms. I also posted a <a href=\"http://wiki.merbivore.com/example_apps/simple_app\" target=\"_blank\">merb example app</a> with sources available on <a href=\"http://github.com/mattetti/simple_merb_example_app/tree/master\" target=\"_blank\">github</a>.Â  While this is not a full app, the example covers:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class=\"level1\">\r\n<div class=\"li\">generating an application</div></li>\r\n	<li class=\"level1\">\r\n<div class=\"li\">generating a resource</div></li>\r\n	<li class=\"level1\">\r\n<div class=\"li\">specing/testing a model</div></li>\r\n	<li class=\"level1\">\r\n<div class=\"li\">adding model validation</div></li>\r\n	<li class=\"level1\">\r\n<div class=\"li\">specing/testing requests</div></li>\r\n	<li class=\"level1\">\r\n<div class=\"li\">modifying views and layouts</div></li>\r\n	<li class=\"level1\">\r\n<div class=\"li\">passing flash messages (messages passed from one action to another)</div></li>\r\n	<li class=\"level1\">\r\n<div class=\"li\">adding authenticated routes</div></li>\r\n	<li class=\"level1\">\r\n<div class=\"li\">testing authenticated requests</div></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFeel free to fork the project, add more branches (one step per branch please, so people can look at the diffs) etc...\r\n\r\nMy goal in writing this example was to show people the basics to get started and especilly how to test a merb app. Note that this is NOT the only way, but I feel strong about TDD and by providing you with simple examples you might also give it a try ;)\r\n\r\nMy next victim will be a Merb slice, I\'ll show you how to easily write and test a Merb slice to use, reuse and abuse your code.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://peepcode.com\"><img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"peepcode\" src=\"http://peepcode.com/images/logo/peepcode.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"263\" height=\"113\" /></a>\r\n\r\nPeepcode released <a href=\"http://peepcode.com/products/meet-merb-pdf-draft\" target=\"_blank\">an updated PDF covering Merb 1.0</a>\r\n\r\nI saw the draft of the upcoming Merb screencast, and once again, Geoffrey does an awesome job teaching you what you need to know.\r\n\r\n(p.s: this blog is not sponsored by peepcode ;) )\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.manning.com/ivey/\"><img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"merb in action\" src=\"http://www.manning.com/ivey/ivey_cover150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"188\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.manning.com/ivey/\" target=\"_blank\">Yehuda\'s beta book on Merb</a> also got updated to cover Merb 1.0.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter is available <a href=\"http://www.manning.com/ivey/katz_meapch1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">for free</a>, the 3 other available chapters cover:\r\n\r\nGetting started With Merb\r\nUsing Merb with a database\r\nAutomated testing\r\n\r\nSince it\'s a beta book, you receive update/new chapters automatically.\r\n\r\n(print version available later on)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2008/08/announcing-the-merb-way-by-foy-savas.html\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-277\" title=\"merb_way_cover\" src=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/merb_way_cover-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\r\n\r\nMerb contributor,<a href=\"http://foysavas.com\" target=\"_blank\"> Foy Savas</a> told me he made a lot of progress on his book and he hopes to have a PDF version out before the end of the year.\r\n\r\nYou can meet Foy in person in Boston on November 17-20 at the Addison-Wesley <a href=\"http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/\">Voices that Matter: Professional Ruby Conference</a>.\r\n\r\n(I can\'t remember who is writing the third book on Merb, please contact me so I can update this section)\r\n\r\nI also noticed a bunch of guys on IRC writing plugins and slices, I hope to see even more tutorials very soon.\r\n<h2>Merb 1.0.1</h2>\r\nMerb 1.0.1 is in the work and should be released in the next few days.

I\'m really sorry about that but at the same time, I really enjoyed <a href=\"http://qconsf.com/sf2008/conference/\" target=\"_blank\">Qcon</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving\" target=\"_blank\">Thanksgiving</a> which did not give me much time to work on a blog post.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_291\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"200\" caption=\"Mr Bean vs X-mas turkey\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-291\" title=\"mr-bean-turkey\" src=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/mr-bean-turkey.jpg\" alt=\"Mr Bean vs X-mas turkey\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" />[/caption]\r\n\r\nThanksgiving is a big thing in America, and after few years I got used to it and I even learned to enjoy this special holiday.\r\n\r\nFor non North American readers, Thanksgiving is a non-religous/family oriented celebration where people get together, eat a lot of food and usually watch an American football game. It\'s followed by \"black-friday\" the first day of X-mas shopping celebrated by huge sales and more recently \"cyber-monday\", the black firday for the web.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I\'ve been visiting family in Florida and didn\'t have much time to work on side projects, including Merb :(\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://qconsf.com/sf2008/conference/\" target=\"_blank\">Qcon</a> was also an awesome event where I met a lot of very interesting people and could measure the Merb interest in the \"Enterprise\" community.\r\n<h2>Merb and the enterprise</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://37signals.com\" target=\"_blank\">37signals</a>, the company known for giving Rails to the Ruby community often talked about the \"Enterprise\" world and the fact that they want to stay far away from it, here is a <a href=\"http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/669-why-enterprise-software-sucks\" target=\"_blank\">quote</a> from 37signals blog:\r\n<blockquote>This is one of the reasons we think enterprise is a dirty word. Itâ€™s also why itâ€™s an absolute pleasure to design products for what we call the Fortune 5,000,000.</blockquote>\r\nOn the other hand, Merb was mainly written by people working at <a href=\"http://engineyard.com\" target=\"_blank\">EngineYard</a>, a company dealing with a lot of so call \"enterprisey\" companies. Because we believe we all have different needs we are willing to help you out with your own needs. That\'s also the reason why, even though none of the core team members use <a href=\"http://www.netbeans.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NetBeans</a> for their day to day coding, we decided to help <a href=\"http://www.netbeans.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NetBeans</a> add Merb support in their next release.\r\n<div id=\"__ss_769389\" style=\"width: 425px; text-align: left;\"><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=merb-for-the-enterprise-1227130962550004-9&amp;stripped_title=merb-for-the-enterprise-presentation\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=merb-for-the-enterprise-1227130962550004-9&amp;stripped_title=merb-for-the-enterprise-presentation\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></div>\r\nInteresting enough, during the preparation of my talk, I did a simple \"hello world\" benchmark and got some really interesting results:\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-292\" title=\"benchmarks\" src=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/benchmarks.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"453\" height=\"335\" />\r\n\r\nNote that Django was tested with mod_python and I was told I could get slightly better results with mod_wsgi.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to hear <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Bray\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Bray</a>, known for his implication with XML and ATOM, mention Merb, DataMapper and CouchDB during his keynote!\r\n\r\nActually, the day before, Yehuda and I had supper with Tim Bray and <a href=\"http://blog.nicksieger.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Sieger</a> from JRuby to discuss few topics but particaluarly how could we improve the framework and of course take advantage of JRuby.\r\n<h2>Merb and the Brazilian community</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/beachgirls.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-293\" title=\"brazilian beach girls\" src=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/beachgirls-229x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"229\" height=\"300\" /></a>Brazil is well known for his beautiful beaches, girls and music. It\'s also known for its soccer team and its BBQ. However it\'s not really known for its software developers and IT community.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there was a lot of Brazilians during Qcon and especially a team from <a href=\"http://www.locaweb.com.br/\" target=\"_blank\">LocaWeb</a>, the biggest Brazilian web hosting!\r\n\r\nYou might not know LocaWeb, but but you might have heard of <a href=\"http://akitaonrails.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fabio Akita</a>. Fabio interviewed a lot of people for his blog and I guess he was bored so he decided to <a href=\"http://akitaonrails.com/2008/11/21/rails-podcast-brasil-qcon-special-john-straw-yellowpages-com-and-matt-aimonetti-merb\" target=\"_blank\">interview me</a> ;)\r\n\r\nWe also sat down for a little while and went through creating a new Merb app, I think Fabio was pretty impressed ;) He was so impressed he mentioned the possibility of aÂ  Merb book in Portuguese!\r\n\r\nLocaWeb also mentioned their interest in offering better Merb hosting with the possibilty to have their own stack for people who decide to host their apps there.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://merb-br.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Here</a> is the site of the Merb community: <a href=\"http://merb-br.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://merb-br.org/</a>\r\n<h2>Rails 2.2</h2>\r\nCongrats to the Rails team for releasing Rails 2.2! The new features are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li> i18n</li>\r\n	<li>HTTP validators</li>\r\n	<li>Thread safety</li>\r\n	<li>JRuby/1.9 compatibility</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI heard a lot of questions about the new Rails features and where does Merb stand. So let me take them address them one by one:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Internationalization.</strong> I, myself was involved with the Rails i18n project so you might be surprise to hear that Merb doesn\'t have a built-in i18n solution.Â  Well, the fact of the matter is that Merb is modular and we don\'t want to force anyone to have to use a i18n solution which will slow down your app. Instead we offer modules to do that. Of course, Merb itself offers hooks to l10n helpers and other stuff you might need. By default, Merb doesn\'t offer UTF-8 string manipulation like ActiveSupport does, however, few months ago, <a href=\"http://github.com/mattetti/multibyte\" target=\"_blank\">I extracted AS\'s feature</a> and you can use the <a href=\"http://github.com/mattetti/multibyte\" target=\"_blank\">extracted gem</a> without the rest of AS while we wait for 1.9 to save the world ;)\r\nMerb makes everything easy for i18n/l10n plugin developers, <a href=\"http://github.com/mattetti/merb_babel/tree/master\" target=\"_blank\">merb_babel</a> and <a href=\"http://github.com/myabc/merb_global/\" target=\"_blank\">merb_global</a> are just 2 of the Merb localization plugins, you\'ll find <a href=\"http://r18n.rubyforge.org/\" target=\"_blank\">many more</a> and some more are coming up.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>HTTP validators/etags</strong>. Merb already had this feature for a little while, I put a <a href=\"http://wiki.merbivore.com/howto/cache/etag\" target=\"_blank\">quick example in the wiki</a>, check it out <a href=\"http://github.com/wycats/merb/tree/ad378ce413769bc1c3d03aefac02e8e32a5432e4/merb-core/lib/merb-core/controller/mixins/conditional_get.rb\" target=\"_blank\"></a> to <a href=\"http://wiki.merbivore.com/howto/cache/etag\" target=\"_blank\">see how to use etag and last-modified tags</a>. Note that you can easy add other custom headers by just doing: headers[\"<a title=\"RFC 2616 â€“ The Cache-Control Header\" href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.9\"><code>Cache-Control\"] = \"max-age=N\"</code></a></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Thread safety</strong>. Well, unlike Rails which added thread safety as an after thought, Merb was built with the concept of thread safety in mind. What does that mean? Well, by default, Merb requests don\'t go through any locks. How? simply because we do not share any data between requests. thread safety is really hard to deal with. However remember that even though your framework is thread safe, your plugins and your code also need to be thread safe. Watch <a href=\"http://rubyconf2008.confreaks.com/what-all-rubyist-should-know-about-threads.html\" target=\"_blank\">Jim\'s talk about threads</a> if you want to know more.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Merb bug fix releases</h2>\r\nYou might have noticed that Merb is at 1.0.3. We fixed few tiny bugs as well as bumped the generated app dependency to the latest version of DM. (DataMapper\'s do_sqlite3 had a conflict with ruby-sqlite3 because of the windows dll pacakged with the gem. Everything has been fixed since.)\r\n<blockquote>Yehuda Katz, explained the release plan in an email to the mailing list:\r\n\r\nWe plan to release point-releases to 1.0 as fixes become available, so there may be more such releases than in Rails. The goal is to release often enough to keep the list of changes in each release relatively small and understandable, and you can feel free to upgrade to the latest point release every 2 weeks if you don\'t want to go through the upgrade process every week (or more frequently). Keep an eye out for point releases that reflect security fixes, because those upgrades should be considered mandatory.</blockquote>\r\nTo see <a href=\"http://merb.lighthouseapp.com/projects/7433-merb/tickets/bins/11568\" target=\"_blank\">1.0.4</a> and <a href=\"http://merb.lighthouseapp.com/projects/7433-merb/tickets/bins/11569\" target=\"_blank\">1.1</a> tickets, check <a href=\"http://merb.lighthouseapp.com/projects/7433-merb/overview\" target=\"_blank\">LightHouse</a>.

Sometimes caused by us, sometimes caused by them. I already addressed this issue in <a href=\"http://merbist.com/2008/11/15/rails-vs-merb-drama/\" target=\"_blank\">this blog post</a>, so let\'s move on.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mac_pc.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-300\" title=\"mac pc ad\" src=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mac_pc-267x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"300\" /></a>Let me first explain the reason for this blog post.<strong> I believe we have a great community but I also believe we like bashing</strong>.\r\n\r\nLike most Rubyists, I use a mac and I often smile when I watch their ads. Then I see Microsoft\'s response ad and I think ... they don\'t get it, I\'m not a Mac, the dude on TV represents the Mac computer. I\'m a human.\r\n\r\nThinking back to our community, I felt that it quickly became: \'Hi, I\'m a Rails developer\' and \'Hi I\'m a Merb developer\'.\r\n\r\n<strong>What started as a simple comparison to explain what the difference was between Merb and Rails quickly escalated into arguments about what framework is best and which one people should use.</strong>\r\n\r\nI hear people in the Ruby community talking trash about Rails and criticize the Rails core team. I even saw people insulting DHH on IRC while he was not even on the channel.\r\n\r\nI, myself, have to admit that I have been guilty of crossing the line a few times and have made some comments which can be considered as \"bashing\".\r\n\r\n<strong>I think now is a good time to apologize and to say that this kind of behavior is not appropriate.</strong>\r\n\r\nAfter all, if we wanted to define ourselves as being \"something\" we probably should say: \"Hi, I\'m a Ruby developer\". Rails is not perfect, nor is Merb. I might disagree with some of the decisions made by the Rails core team but I still think Rails is a great framework and the Rails team has done an awesome job and deserves a lot of respect for its efforts. We are all part of the Ruby community and I think it\'s time we all (starting by myself) act as a unified community.\r\n\r\nWithout further ado, here is my ...\r\n<h3>Top 10 reasons why we â™¡ Rails:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Without Rails, the Ruby language would not be <a href=\"http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe_index/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">one of the top 10 programming languages</a></li>\r\n	<li>Without Rails, we would still be writing <a href=\"http://www.skywayradio.com/tech/iSeries/wps/admxmsmp.html\" target=\"_blank\">thousand-line configuration files in XML</a> to start your small app</li>\r\n	<li>Without Rails, most developers would not know what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller\" target=\"_blank\">MVC</a> stands for</li>\r\n	<li>Without Rails, I would not be a Ruby web developer</li>\r\n	<li>Without Rails, we would not have <a href=\"http://merbivore.com\" target=\"_blank\">Merb</a></li>\r\n	<li>Without Rails, we would not have all the other cool Ruby frameworks</li>\r\n	<li>Without Rails, <a href=\"http://rspec.info\" target=\"_blank\">testing</a> would be something only the elite would do</li>\r\n	<li>Without Rails, serving Ruby web apps would be a pain in the neck</li>\r\n	<li>Without Rails, <a href=\"http://www.zedshaw.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zed Shaw</a> would not be famous</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBonus items:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Without Matz, there would be no Ruby</li>\r\n	<li>Without Ruby, there would be no Rails</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNext time you think, I\'m a Merb or I\'m a Rails, think twice :)','Merb â™¡ Rails',0,'','publish','open','open','','merb-loves-rails','','\nhttp://merbist.com/2008/11/15/rails-vs-merb-drama/','2008-12-17 11:58:01','2008-12-17 19:58:01','',0,'http://merbist.com/?p=299',0,'post','',23),(315,1,'2008-12-04 23:18:31','2008-12-05 07:18:31','<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-314 aligncenter\" title=\"google-insights-worldwide-jul-dec-2008\" src=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/google-insights-worldwide-jul-dec-2008.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"149\" /></p>\r\n\r\nHere is a graph representing the growth of of web searches related to the programming category. This is not a comparison of the amount of searches made.\r\n\r\nWe can see  a huge peak around the time Merb 1.0 got released. More and more people are looking for information about what\'s already being called the \"Ruby web framework for the enterprise\". This is obviously a very interesting and encouraging trend. The problem is that unfortunately, the reality is that when you search for Merb documentation you don\'t get very useful results.\r\n\r\nWorse still, the main complaint we get is the lack of end user documentation. No fancy screensavers, no demo applications, just a simple, well organized but not expansive <a href=\"http://wiki.merbivore.com\" target=\"_blank\">wiki</a>. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m really proud of our wiki. The wiki was restarted from scratch during the 1.0 RC era and we have some really decent documentation including a step by step BDD example with code on GitHub. The problem is that wikis, in general, are not easy to read when you want to learn a new technology. But they are great when you look for answers to a specific question, like: how do I use authentication, how do use transaction specs with RSpec...\r\n\r\nThe Ruby community is used to not having great open source documentation and to purchasing books written by experts. I remember when I joined the Ruby community, the company I was working for was looking at three frameworks: one written in PHP, the other in Python and the last one in Ruby. The Python framework was the fastest but didn\'t have a testing harness. The PHP framework had great documentation but was PHP (no comment).Â  And the Ruby framework almost did not have any documentation but had great momentum. It also had a book released which kind of compensated for the lack of documentation. (I don\'t think we would have picked the Ruby framework if all the engineers did not fall in love with the language :p)\r\n\r\nMerb has 4 books in the process of being written, 2 of them already available in Beta. This is really exciting but it doesn\'t answer the need of two types of audiences:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>People who decide to give Merb a try and don\'t have much time/patience/money ;)</li>\r\n	<li>People outside of the English speaking world (yes, even though according to Hollywood, even aliens speak English, the reality is that a lot of people prefer to read documentation in their native language)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLooking at other frameworks, a lot of the well known ones offer free books. <a href=\"http://www.djangoproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Django</a> has its famous <a href=\"http://djangobook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Django Book</a>, <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org\" target=\"_blank\">Symfony</a> has its <a href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_2/\" target=\"_blank\">book</a>...\r\n\r\nTo address the needs of people who want to get started quickly, we probably need to write some great tutorials. I think we will soon focus on that. People have already started writing awesome tutorials on getting started with glassfish and Merb and other cool things. However, most of these tutorials are designed for people who already have some Ruby knowledge. So the core team will probably need to help the community get a bit more organized and write some good simple tutorials for total newbies. However this is not really hard to do.\r\n\r\nThe real challenge for me is to reach the foreign audience. As you have probably noticed by the amount of English mistakes I make, I\'m not a native English speaker. I remember learning English by asking my mom to translate computer messages I was getting when using my cousin\'s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC\" target=\"_blank\">Amstrad CPC</a> and my dad\'s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC-1512\" target=\"_blank\">Amstrad PC 1512.</a> The first English words I remember learning were: \"Game Over\" and \"insert the floppy disk\" :)\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"book\" src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/69/206957476_e74acf006e_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" />Talking with Brazilian Ruby evangelist Fabio Akita about his books, he reminded me how hard it is to get up to date IT documentation in your mother tongue. People talk about Globalization but in a time were knowledge is power, people outside of the US are still getting IT books one to two years after their US release.\r\n\r\nPDF books make things a bit easier but you still need to be able to understand and of course you need to hope the online shop will accept your \"foreign\" card.\r\n<h2>Merb book</h2>\r\nThe Merb team has decided to support the documentation effort. At first we thought about updating Matthew Ford\'s <a href=\"http://merb.4ninjas.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Merb 4 ninja book</a>. But the project was started when Merb 0.3.x was released and needed a huge amount of work to be brought up to date.\r\n\r\nAfter talking with Matthew, we decided it was probably better to start a new project backed by the core team. I quickly put together a simple localized Merb app rendering markdown files using awesome <a href=\"http://maruku.rubyforge.org/\" target=\"_blank\">maruku</a>.\r\n\r\nThe app is simple to use, simple for editors to contribute content, simple for translators to do their job.\r\n\r\nWe gathered three Merb book authors: Yehuda Katz, Foy Savas and Matthew Ford and worked on an initial <a href=\"http://github.com/mattetti/merb-book/tree/master/book-content/en/toc.markdown\" target=\"_blank\">table of contents</a>. At the same time, I got in contact with Fabio Akita, Mathieu Fosse and Makoto Kuwata to see if they were interested in leading the translation in Portuguese, French and Japanese. Everybody got really excited and wanted to start as soon as possible. Here is a short list of goals for the book:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>From the community, for the community</li>\r\n	<li>Creative Commons share alike type copyright</li>\r\n	<li>Simple, organized and up to date documentation of the Merb stack</li>\r\n	<li>Focus on the common use cases</li>\r\n	<li>Early localization to allow centralized, up to date documentation in various languages</li>\r\n	<li>Export to static HTML and PDF</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe initial work is available in my <a href=\"http://github.com/mattetti/merb-book/tree/master\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repo</a> and we are planning on publishing an updated version of the book daily. The book will be tagged at the same time as Merb releases, to allow people to go back in time and check the book for a previous version of the framework.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in helping, it\'s very simple:\r\n\r\nadd/modify content:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>clone the book repo</li>\r\n	<li>modify/add content</li>\r\n	<li>rebase to avoid conflicts</li>\r\n	<li>send me a pull request</li>\r\n</ul>\r\ntranslate content:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Find out who the translator leader is for your language (check the readme file in the repo)</li>\r\n	<li>clone the book repo</li>\r\n	<li>add translations</li>\r\n	<li>send the leader your pull request</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf there is no translator leader for your language, contact me.\r\n\r\nI really hope to be able to add Spanish, German and Chinese pretty soon. If you are willing to lead the translation work for these languages, please contact me via email (mattaimonetti at Gmail or via github).\r\n\r\nJoin the mailing list if you want to get the latest news or discuss the content.\r\n<table style=\"background-color: #fff; padding: 5px;\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><img src=\"http://groups.google.com/groups/img/3nb/groups_bar.gif\" alt=\"Google Groups\" width=\"132\" height=\"26\" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px\"><strong>Subscribe to the merb book mailing list </strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<form action=\"http://groups.google.com/group/merb-book/boxsubscribe\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"padding-left: 5px;\">Email:\r\n\r\n<input name=\"email\" type=\"text\" /> <input name=\"sub\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" /></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</form>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"right\"><a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/merb-book\">Visit this group</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\nFinally, Yehuda has been working on another very simple Merb app to let you find available methods and their documentation in context. RDoc is fine, but how do you know what methods are available when you are in a view, and what about in a Model? Once again, the concept is to make your life as developer easier. For a long time we have focused on the framework itself. It\'s now time we focused on making it easy to use so more people can enjoy the power and flexibility of Merb.\r\n\r\nOf course, all of this is done for you. So if you have any comments, concerns, advise, feel free to contact us directly or leave a comment.','Annoucing the Merb open source book',0,'','publish','open','open','','annoucing-the-merb-open-source-book','','','2008-12-17 11:58:30','2008-12-17 19:58:30','',0,'http://merbist.com/?p=315',0,'post','',20),(325,1,'2008-12-08 00:13:13','2008-12-08 08:13:13','3 days ago, I announced the <a href=\"http://merbist.com/2008/12/04/annoucing-the-merb-open-source-book/\" target=\"_blank\">Merb Open Source Book project</a>. I expected that few people would be interested as we heard complaints about the lack of documentation.\r\n\r\nWhat I did not expect, was more than 60 emails and pull requests in 2 days, people committing pages of content, fixes and offering their services to translate the book. The <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/merb-book\" target=\"_blank\">mailing list</a> already has 60+ members and the <a href=\"http://github.com/mattetti/merb-book/tree/master\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a> is being watched by 150+ people and has 50+ forks.\r\n\r\nWhile this could be almost overwhelming, I think this is very encouraging. I have to say that since 1.0 got released we heard a lot of praises and and lot of complaints. The Merb team has been trying to prioritize and address reported challenges one after the other. We recently announced that user documentation was our top priority and we decided to work on two projects:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>better access to the code documentation</li>\r\n	<li>Open Source book</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Code browsing:</h2>\r\nGood news, we have an early beta of the new code browser: <a href=\"http://docsbeta.merbivore.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://docsbeta.merbivore.com/</a>\r\n\r\nThis is still an early beta and only works properly on FireFox and Safari. You\'ll notice that currently, only merb-core\'s public methods are available. merb-more addition is coming soon.\r\n\r\nSo what\'s special about this code browser?\r\n\r\nContextual search and API filtering. In lay terms, you can see what public methods are available to you based on what you are doing. (are you in a controller, model, the console?)\r\n<h2>Open Source Book</h2>\r\nI put an early beta online: <a href=\"http://book.merbist.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://book.merbist.com\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nThis is not a static version yet meaning that the markdown files get converted for every single request. I\'m waiting for Geoffrey Grosenbach to finish his <a href=\"http://github.com/topfunky/merb_static/tree/master\" target=\"_blank\">merb_static plugin</a>. Once he will be done with the spidering, his plugin will automatically export the site as static HTML. The PDF version will be exported using a gem called UFO written by wycats. UFO is a JRuby bridge to Flying Saucer, an awesome Java library which can convert HTML to PDF.\r\n\r\nAs you can see if you browse the book, we don\'t have a lot of content yet. However, you need to realize that we just started 3 days ago! That is what\'s so amazing. People didn\'t sit back and wait for some core team members to write the content. To the contrary, they have been submitting content and have already started the book translation into 10 languages:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>English</li>\r\n	<li>French</li>\r\n	<li>Japanese</li>\r\n	<li>Portuguese</li>\r\n	<li>German</li>\r\n	<li>Chinese</li>\r\n	<li>Spanish</li>\r\n	<li>Russian</li>\r\n	<li>Bosnian</li>\r\n	<li style=\"text-align: left;\">Dutch</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI expect to receive the first Italian translations early next week and I was promised some Indian languages too.\r\n\r\n<strong>Props to the entire community for putting its money where its mouth is!</strong>\r\n<h2>What\'s next?</h2>\r\n<a href=\"http://yehudakatz.com\" target=\"_blank\">Yehuda Katz</a> was in Atlanta at <a href=\"http://merbday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MerbDay</a> and had a great keynote about the future of Merb:\r\n<div id=\"__ss_826626\" style=\"width: 425px; text-align: left;\"><a style=\"font:14px Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;display:block;margin:12px 0 3px 0;text-decoration:underline;\" title=\"Merb Day Keynote\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/wycats/merb-day-keynote-presentation?type=powerpoint\">Merb Day Keynote</a><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=merbdaykeynote-1228671280209791-9&amp;rel=0&amp;stripped_title=merb-day-keynote-presentation\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=merbdaykeynote-1228671280209791-9&amp;rel=0&amp;stripped_title=merb-day-keynote-presentation\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></div>\r\n<div id=\"__ss_826626\" style=\"width: 425px; text-align: left;\">However, in the short term, we\'ll still focus on documentation, bug fixes and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/wycats/status/1044577046\" target=\"_blank\">recently added as a top priority</a>: Merb and gem dependencies issues (Rubygems)</div>\r\n<h2 style=\"width: 425px; text-align: left;\">DataMapper news</h2>\r\n<div style=\"width: 425px; text-align: left;\">Our good friends from the DM team <a href=\"http://twitter.com/datamapper/status/1044706717\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> DataMapper 0.9.8 and Extlib 0.9.9.

I remember struggling with the very same problem when I started using Rails a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that the core team is working hard on improving the state of documentation.\r\n\r\nYou have the <a href=\"http://book.merbist.com\" target=\"_blank\">Merb Book</a> on which I am actively work on with a team of 20 people (writers, editors and translators).\r\n\r\nYou also have the <a href=\"http://docsbeta.merbivore.com/klasses/Merb::Parse\" target=\"_blank\">documentation browsing application</a> we are developing to let you browse documentation based on where you are in your app.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, you have the 2 beta books (<a href=\"http://manning.com/ivey/\" target=\"_blank\">Merb in Action</a> and the <a href=\"http://safari.oreilly.com/9780321601636\" target=\"_blank\">Merb way</a>) plus two other ones in the process of being written (<a href=\"http://www.apress.com/book/view/9781430218234\" target=\"_blank\">Beginning Merb</a> and <a onmouseover=\"hoverbook(1142, this);\" onmouseout=\"hoverbookoff(this);\" href=\"http://apress.com/book/view/9781430218654\">Merb: What You Need to Know</a>).\r\n\r\nFinally, you also have other resources like the <a href=\"http://peepcode.com/products/meet-merb-pdf-draft\" target=\"_blank\">Merb peepcode</a>.\r\n\r\nThe point being that we are actively working on improving the overall state of documentation.

My goal is to feature various people from our community and ask them a few questions about Ruby, Merb and their projects.\r\n\r\nLet\'s get started with <a href=\"http://derekneighbors.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Neighbors</a> from <a href=\"http://integrumtech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Integrum</a>.\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> Hi Derek, could you please introduce yourself and the company you work for?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Derek Neighbors:</strong> I am Derek Neighbors and I work for Integrum Technologies, an agile software company based in Chandler, AZ focused on web solutions using Ruby.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> How did you get started with Ruby, what\'s your background?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Derek Neighbors:</strong> We were doing custom software development using PHP and Python.  We mostly had Python backends with PHP front ends that would communicate via XML-RPC.  While this was working, it just didn\'t feel productive.  We had heard some inklings about this new framework called Ruby on Rails.  It was nearing 1.0 and so we decided to do an important but relatively simple e-commerce application in it.  We fell in love almost immediately and within 3 months started solely using Ruby for development.  The productivity gain just could not be ignored.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> You chose to learn, support and use Merb, could you please let us know why?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Derek Neighbors:</strong> We deal with a lot of customers that also have opinions.  When we need to work to integrate into their systems, we need the flexibility to do things their way at times.  Having to dismantle a framework to do little things can be frustrating.  Having a framework with solid engineering practices behind it better allows our developers to help improve or deviate from the framework when necessary.  This is something we were struggling with in Ruby on Rails.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> Do you have a public project you wrote using Merb that people can look at?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Derek Neighbors:</strong> We have an academic scheduling program we are starting to work on, but have not yet released.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> What is your favorite aspect of the Merb framework?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Derek Neighbors:</strong> It reminds me of unix.  Lots of small pieces that do their job really well, that when combined make up something pretty spectacular.  If you don\'t need a piece you can leave it out.  If you like emacs (datamapper) instead of vi (active record) then use it.  In particular, the concept of Merb Slices is very appealing for code re-use.  Something we have struggled with in Ruby on Rails to date.  While plug-ins help with re-use there is nothing that would allow the flexibility that say merb-auth enjoys today as a slice.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> Could you please mention an aspect of Merb you hope to see be improved in the near future?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Derek Neighbors: </strong>Documentation is pretty high on the list, but also losing some of the \"you have to be a ruby hacker to use merb\" implications. While it is a hacker\'s framework, things like opinionated stacks and talks of Django-like admin interfaces make it sound pretty appealing to the non-hacker audience as well.  I am looking forward to Merb not being only for hackers, but still preferred by hackers.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> Thank you for your time. Anything else you would like to add?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Derek Neighbors: </strong>I just want to thank Merb-Core for their dedication and passion towards Merb.  I think believing in quality and having the determination to make frameworks take it to the next level is what improvement is all about.  I thank them for loving Ruby on Rails enough to push the development of both Merb and Ruby on Rails forward by not being okay with \"good enough\".  People don\'t tell open source programmers enough how much they are appreciated.  So Merb-Core..

I originally became interested in software development when I was 10.  Since then, I have been a professional developer for over 10 years now and currently work as a Senior Software Engineer for AT&amp;T Interactive.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti</strong> How did you get started with Ruby, what\'s your background?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Lori Holden:</strong> Years ago I had been hearing talk about an \'upcoming\' new language called Ruby.  At the time it didn\'t have many people in the US working with it, but I really loved how similar to Smalltalk it was.\r\n\r\nMy core background experience is centered around Ruby, Java, C++, PHP, and Javascript.  Outside of that, I consider myself a language geek... and have quite a bit of experience in Python, Smalltalk, OCaml, IO Language, and Perl, along with several others.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti</strong> You chose to learn, support and use Merb, could you please let us know why and how that happened?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Lori Holden:</strong> I was one of the original Rails developers.  Since then, I have used Rails off and on... but have found myself growing more and more unsatisfied with it.  On top of that, I have also found myself growing out of touch with the core developers over the last couple years, which I am sure doesn\'t help things.\r\nMerb is fresh.  I find it carries a lot less baggage with it than Rails.  Even better, the project is still small and I seem to get along quite well with the the other developers on the project.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti</strong> You have been contributing to the Merb project and gave a Sequel presentation during MerbCamp 08, what is your motivation?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Lori Holden:</strong> Primarily, I just like the developers.  Everyone seems to be really passionate about Merb and are willing to push it in some really cool directions.  At the same time, Merb still manages to remain slim and with very little bloat.\r\nI really enjoy helping projects push through to release and I was glad to be a part of that for Merb.\r\nSequel is a really wonderful tool, and I was finding that just not that many people in the Merb community were using it.  I had a lot of experience with getting Merb and Sequel to work with each other, and figured I should share my experience with everyone else.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> What is your favorite aspect of the Merb framework?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Lori Holden:</strong> This is a really odd one, but my favorite aspect of Merb is that I know it very well inside and out.  If I need to browse the source for some feature, I already know where to go and what to look at.  I attribute this to how slim the merb-core has remained.  I think it is quite easy to work with.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> Could you please mention an aspect of Merb you hope to see be improved in the near future?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Lori Holden:</strong> Merb is still immature in some areas.  Gem management is one thing that I am finding to be a bit lacking.  The support for Sequel could use a bit more improvement... but I suppose that\'s something I should work on.  And finally, something that I hope Merb always works on: Keep it Small. Keep it Simple. Keep it Core. Bloat should be a plugin away, not an upgrade.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> Thank you for your time. Anything else you would like to add?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Lori Holden:</strong> Thank you Matt.

I got started with Ruby by way of learning Rails. I used to do some hacking on perl and php but never anything for full time work until Rails came along. I fell in love with the Ruby language that way.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> You chose to learn and use Merb, could you please let us know why and how that happened?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Jason Seifer:</strong> Doing the Rails Envy podcast, I\'ve been keeping up with the latest merb news for a while now. Along the way I\'ve been extremely impressed by how the merb team handles things, listens to its users, and implements new features. At the same time, I\'m pretty lazy when it comes to coding so I wanted to wait until the API was stable and version 1.0ish before jumping in to building merb apps. I have a lot of Rails experience so picking it up wasn\'t too hard.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> Do you have some Merb projects available online we can look at? what was your experience so far?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Jason Seifer:</strong> I don\'t have anything online at the moment but I am working on a couple of things that I hope to release in the coming months. Working with merb is a pleasure most of the time, though it\'s pretty easy to get confused with some common rails functions that differ slightly by name (before/before_filter, etc) if you\'ve been doing Rails for a while. One thing that\'s really nice about working with merb is how compact and easy to understand the framework code is. It\'s very easy to jump in and see how something works if you\'re having trouble.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> What is your favorite aspect of the Merb framework?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Jason Seifer:</strong> As far as features go, I love run_later. It\'s pretty nice not to have to run a message queue for decoupling simple things like sending email from the request/response cycle. There are a number of smaller features like that which make merb nice to work with.<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\nMy favorite aspect of merb, though, is the stable api. It\'s very comforting to know that by upgrading to the next stable point release of the framework that I\'m not going to have things that break. This of course doesn\'t mean that a stable and comprehensive test suite isn\'t important but it is one less worry.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> Could you please mention an aspect of Merb you hope to see being improved in the near future?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Jason Seifer:</strong> If you had asked me this question a few weeks ago I would have said documentation, but that itch is being scratched by the merb book. Though not exactly merb, I\'d really love to see DataMapper get JRuby compatibility so we can get the full stack on JRuby for deployment. That would be very exciting what with everything going on in JRuby land at the moment.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> Thank you for your time. Anything else you would like to add?</div>\r\n<strong>Jason Seifer:</strong>\r\nI would encourage people to try merb if they\'ve been holding out at all. It\'s a great time to get involved and the community is great, too. Also, I\'ll be starting a merb podcast soon so stay tuned for that.

I work primarily on\r\ninternal and customer facing projects.  These projects are almost\r\nexclusively written in Merb.  At Engine Yard we take advantage of many\r\nof the modular aspects of Merb.  For example, we use Salesforce for\r\ncustomer tracking and have a Merb slice which includes the DataMapper\r\nadapters for Salesforce.  This gives us the ability to interact with\r\nsalesforce from any application for free.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> How did you get started with Ruby, and what\'s your general programming background?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Andy Delcambre:</strong> I majored in Computer Science at college and had been hearing about\r\nRuby and Ruby on Rails for a while before I finally dove in.  I worked\r\nfor the College of Engineering as a Linux Administrator and took the\r\nopportunity to build my first rails application: a tool for managing\r\nour automated deployments.  This was a huge learning experience, I had\r\ndone web development in raw php before, but this was my first time\r\nusing a framework.  It was both a bit overwhelming and a breath of\r\nfresh air.  When I graduated from University, I decided to pursue Ruby\r\nand Rails as a career path and have yet to look back.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> You chose to contribute to Merb;  how and why did that happened?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Andy Delcambre:</strong> I was working at Planet Argon (http://planetargon.com), a small Ruby\r\non Rails development company and was looking to do some open source\r\ncontributions.  I had been hearing quite a lot about Merb in the rails\r\ncommunity, especially that it was smaller, lighter and faster.  I\r\ndecided to look in the bug tracker and see if there was something\r\nsmall I could tackle and found a bug with the way nil and false\r\ndefault arguments were handled in merb_action_args.  When my patch was\r\naccepted I was fairly hooked.  I have been submitting small patches\r\never since.  I also led the inline documentation team at the Merb\r\nsprint in San Diego during the run up to 1.0</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> Do you have any Merb projects available online we can look at? What\'s your experience been so far?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Andy Delcambre:</strong> All of my merb projects are projects at Engine Yard right now.  I\r\nwrote a simple Merb app to manage the content on the Engine Yard\r\nhomepage and the blog is based on the Feather blogging engine, written\r\nin Merb.  My current projects are not yet publicly available but\r\nshould be very cool when they come out.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> What is your favorite aspect of the Merb framework?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Andy Delcambre:</strong> I have two answers, first as a someone who works on merb, then as\r\nsomeone who works with merb.\r\n\r\nEver since that first patch to action_args, I have loved the ease with\r\nwhich I can jump in and dig under the hood.  I have dug down into the\r\nrouter, the dispatcher, the form helpers, and the mailer, all without\r\nmuch problem understanding the code.\r\n\r\nSecond, as a developer of merb applications I think the direction merb\r\nis going with the heavy emphasis on modularity is fantastic.  In the\r\napp I am currently working on, we are using four different slices\r\nright now.  One of which is an entirely different merb app modified\r\nslightly and mounted within the application.  One is a custom\r\nmerb-auth strategy that we use internally that makes it much much\r\neasier to maintain consistency for our internal applications.  These\r\nwould be much much harder to integrate for most other frameworks.  It\r\nis so useful to be able to just plug in these small, specific pieces\r\nof functionality.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> What parts of Merb you hope to see improved in the near future?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Andy Delcambre:</strong> I am looking forward to the future improvements to the modularity of\r\nmerb.  I am really ready for the day that you can mount entire merb\r\napps inside one another.  Then, once everything uses merb-auth, I can\r\nimagine mounting a blog and a cms inside the same \"app\" and have the\r\nusers shared across, automatically.  How awesome would that be.</div>\r\n<br class=\"spacer\" />\r\n<div class=\"mtm-question\"><strong>Matt Aimonetti:</strong> Anything else you would like to add?</div>\r\n<div class=\"mtm-answer\"><strong>Andy Delcambre:</strong> I am looking forward to being part of the merb community as this\r\nproject just keeps getting better and kicking more butt.

This is so exciting! Nobody believed it could ever happen (I personally, seriously had my doubt).\r\n\r\nYehuda had a <a href=\"http://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/23/rails-and-merb-merge/\" target=\"_blank\">great post</a> laying out the plan and explaining things in details. Check out <a href=\"http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/23/merb-gets-merged-into-rails-3\" target=\"_blank\">David\'s post </a>explaining why he wants us to work together and his vision of a better Ruby world.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I have been impressed by the Rails core team and especially David (DHH).\r\n\r\nI\'ve known David for few years now and we had long (sometimes heated) discussions on topics like i18n/l10n for Rails. David is known to be a very opinionated person. But if you come up with the right arguments, he can be convinced and when that happens, he is willing to move forward and shake things up.\r\n\r\nThis merge is a concrete example that David and the rest of the Rails team care about Rails and the Ruby community more than we usually give them credit for. As a unified team, we are going to change the way web development in Ruby is done!\r\n\r\nBut what does it mean for you?\r\n\r\nI put together a FAQ video which, I hope will answer your questions.\r\n\r\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2607919&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=2607919&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>\r\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/2607919\">Matt Aimonetti: message to all merbists</a>\r\n\r\nTranscript:\r\n\r\nHi, I\'m Matt Aimonetti from the merb core team and as you might have heard, a big announcement was made earlier today.\r\nI did this video to hopefully answer the questions you might have.\r\n<h3>Q: So what\'s the big news?</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>merb and Rails team will work together on the next version of their frameworks</li>\r\n	<li>merb 2.0 and Rails 3.0 share the same common endpoint</li>\r\n	<li>we realized we now have the same objectives and agreed on all the key principles.</li>\r\n	<li>merb will provide Rails with agnosticism, modularity, improved performance and a public API.</li>\r\n	<li>The end product will be called Rails 3.0 but what real matters is that it\'s a huge gain for the entire community.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Q: What??? I thought there was a war going on between Rails and merb, what happened?</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li> There was no war between Rails and merb</li>\r\n	<li> We created merb because Rails was not fitting us</li>\r\n	<li> We wanted better performance, more choices/ more modularity and a Public API.</li>\r\n	<li> The Rails team now embraces these concepts and want Rails to follow them, so why not work together?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Q: Wait, does that mean that merb is dead?</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li> Absolutely not!</li>\r\n	<li> merb development won\'t stop, we are going to keep on releasing updates until Rails 3.0</li>\r\n	<li> clear migration path, and upgrading to Rails 3.0 will be as trivial as upgrading from Rails 2.x to Rails 3.0</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Q: What does the timeline look like?</h3>\r\nWe just started getting together to discuss the technical details. We are shooting for a release at RailsConf 2009. However it\'s hard to estimate this kind of thing so, again, that\'s just an estimate :)\r\n<h3>Q: I just started a merb project, so what now?</h3>\r\nI\'m sure you had valid reasons to use merb, you needed modularity, performance and a solid API.\r\nKeep on using Merb, we won\'t let you down. The good news is that the next version of merb (Rails 3.0) will be even awesomer!\r\n<h3>Q: What about my client who was looking at using merb for his new project?</h3>\r\nIf your client is going to be using merb for valid reasons (and not just because it\'s not Rails) they should still use merb, but with the full understanding that they will end up using Rails in 6 months or so. Again, Rails 3.0 will have what pushed you to use merb.\r\n<h3>Q: I\'ve been involved with the merb-book, what will happen with this project?</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li> Rails 3.0 won\'t get released right away</li>\r\n	<li> still need awesome documentation</li>\r\n	<li> if we look at Rails 3.0 as merb 2.0, we can easily imagine how the current work can be extended to the new version</li>\r\n	<li> Rails team will also include an evangelism team which I will be part of, so will be able to focus more on projects like the book</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Q: I\'ve been working on a merb plugin, what should I do?</h3>\r\nKeep working on it! We\'ll assist you with the migration process and the new solid API.\r\n<h3>Q: What if I still have questions?</h3>\r\nCome talk with me, or any member of the new team. We\'ll be open to hear your questions, worries, frustrations.\r\nmerb always valued its developers and we will continue to do so but on a bigger scale.\r\n\r\n<hr />Concretely, nothing changes for merb users. People loving merb should not worry. The way you build merb apps won\'t change until merb2.0/Rails3.0. We will still work on your favorite framework and improve it.\r\n\r\nLori Holden worked on merb_sequel and we should release a 1.0 release of the plugin in a few days.\r\n\r\nI\'m sure this news comes as a shock for many of you, but try to not see Rails 3.0 as the way Rails is right now. Imagine a version of Rails with true modularity and agnosticism (sequel, DM and AR will still be supported) and the same type of performance as what you get with merb. In other words, the Rails world is about to discover the power of merb!\r\n\r\nHere is what Yehuda explicitly says in his blog post:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Rails will become more modular, starting with a rails-core, and including the ability to opt in or out of specific components. [...]</li>\r\n	<li>We will port all of our performance improvements into Rails. This includes architectural decisions that are big performance wins.[..]</li>\r\n	<li>As of Rails 3, Rails will have a defined public API with a test suite for that API. [..]</li>\r\n	<li>Rails will still ship with the \"stack\" version as the default (just as merb does since 1.0), but the goal is to make it easy to do with Rails what people do with merb today.</li>\r\n	<li>Rails will be modified to more easily support DataMapper or Sequel as first-class ORMs. [..]</li>\r\n	<li>Rails will continue their recent embrace of Rack, which [..] will improve the state of modular, sharable logic between applications.</li>\r\n	<li>In general, we will take a look at features in merb that are not in Rails (the most obvious example is the more robust router) and find a way to bring them into Rails.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Personal perspective</h2>\r\nI\'m personally really excited about this opportunity. I had a hard time believing that we could work together but I was proved wrong. We have many challenges in front of us, but watching the two teams working together is very reassuring.\r\n\r\nI\'m also glad to see that we will have a Rails Evangelism team that I will be part of. I strongly believe that one of the many reasons why merb has been so successful is because we work and listen to our community. We have put a tremendous amount of energy into trying to understand what you guys need and what you like and dislike. In return, we have seen many people working hard on the wiki and the merb-book.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine doing that with almost 4 Million Rails developers?\r\n\r\nI\'m also looking forward to working with a team and reaching to even more people.\r\n<h2>Other news related to the merge:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The RubyOnRails website will keep a trace of this historical moment: <a href=\"http://rubyonrails.org/merb\" target=\"_blank\">http://rubyonrails.org/merb</a></li>\r\n	<li>The <a href=\"http://merbclass.com/\" target=\"_blank\">merb training scheduled for Jan 19-21</a>, in partnership with <a href=\"http://integrumtech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Integrum</a>, will still take place, and if you want to get a head start and learn about the things that will make Rails 3.0 totally kick ass, I\'d suggest you join us.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you have any questions, or if you want me to publicly answer questions on your blog please contact me.

People who used to argue and not get along, have decided to sit down, talk and evaluate their differences. The end result is a strong collaboration of two teams who share the exact same goal.\r\n\r\nOverall, the news was very well received, just look at the tweets out there and the comments on <a href=\"http://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/23/rails-and-merb-merge/\" target=\"_blank\">Yehuda\'s</a> and <a href=\"http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/23/merb-gets-merged-into-rails-3\" target=\"_blank\">Rails\' blogs</a>.\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, the Rails community really embraced this decision and just got totally excited about the perspective of merging merb\'s philosophy and expertise into Rails. If you re-read David\'s blog post you can see that it\'s a <strong>real homage to Merb</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the internet sounds pretty happy about the news, here are few posts:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081224-ruby-on-rails-and-merb-to-merge-for-rails-3.html\" target=\"_blank\">arstechnica.com</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3793296/Merb+Merges+With+Rails.htm\" target=\"_blank\">internetnews</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEven <a href=\"http://www.zedshaw.com\" target=\"_blank\">Zed the entertainer</a> thought it was a good thing:\r\n<blockquote><a href=\"http://www.zedshaw.com/blog/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"I honestly didnâ€™t think that would ever happen.

This is also something the Merb core team considered for a little bit.\r\nMerb is gaining huge momentum and the target audience was very reactive to what we did.\r\n<a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/mhaithaca/1317815300/\"><img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"super heroes\" src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1087/1317815300_095983272e_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" /></a>People such as Yellow Pages, Wikipedia and even Adobe started using or looking seriously at Merb because of its focus on modularity and performance.\r\nWe started building an elite community and we were pretty proud of that.\r\n\r\nBut take a moment to think about it. Our goal has never been to hurt or compete with Rails. Our goals were to get modularity, performance and a strong API. If the Rails team really wants that, and will work on it, why should we work against each other?\r\nIt\'s not about winning or losing. It\'s all about the long term plan of your framework, about the people involved and the community behind it. We had to take ourselves out of the equation and consider what would be good for the Ruby community.\r\n<h2>What does Merb win by being merged into Rails?</h2>\r\nPeople seem to easily find things we might lose but have a hard time finding things we are gaining.\r\n<img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-404\" title=\"rails\" src=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/rails.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"87\" height=\"112\" />Looking at it on the very short term, this is probably correct. The merb team will have to learn how to work with the Rails team.\r\nWe need to understand the reasons behind every single aspect of the code and find ways of merging things nicely.\r\nOn top of that, we still need to work on merb as promised. (see Wycats\' post)\r\n\r\nHowever, in the long term we get all the benefits of Rails:\r\n- stability\r\n- community\r\n- traction\r\n- experience\r\n- don\'t have to always justify why use Merb instead of Rails\r\n\r\nBut more importantly, we extend our team.\r\n\r\nMost people using a framework might not realize what it is to work on a big Open Source project.\r\nWhen you work on an OSS project, people come and go, and that\'s why you usually have a core team of people you can rely on.\r\nMerb has a lot of contributors but a small core team of 5 people (Yehuda, Carl, Daniel, Michael and myself).\r\nManaging a project, such as merb, requires a tremendous amount of time and patience. Rails has the same problem with its core team of 6 people. People have lives, business, projects etc...\r\n\r\nJoining two teams of experts in developing web frameworks in Ruby is like if in the next Soccer World Cup, the French and Italian teams would go on the fields at the same time to beat other teams. 22 players on 1 side, training and learning together. American readers, please imagine the Giants and the Colts facing the Green Bay Packers (I was told I don\'t like the Packers).\r\n\r\nLong term, you will get better quality and more frequent releases. We also have different world views and backgrounds which means we will learn a lot from each other, again that means better code for you guys :)\r\n<h2>Why not merge Rails into Merb?</h2>\r\nThat\'s actually a good question. We discussed maybe using merb-core as a base for Rails 3.0\r\nThe truth is that Merb 2.0 would probably be as big as Rails but more modular.\r\nSo we have the choice to keep on building on top of Merb 2.0 or deconstruct Rails.\r\nAs the Russians say: \'Ð»Ð¾Ð¼Ð°Ñ‚ÑŒ â€” Ð½Ðµ ÑÑ‚Ñ€Ð¾Ð¸Ñ‚ÑŒ\', it\'s always easier to take things apart ;)\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright\" title=\"merge rails\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3033/2814371262_04b9876490_m.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" />Rails already has a test suite, it has already been tested on the wild for a while and its internals are known to many developers. Taking apart the code to make it faster, cleaner and more modular is arguably easier than reinventing the wheel. At the end of the day it doesn\'t really matter from which end you start as long as you end up with the same result.\r\n\r\nSome people even asked to come up with a new name for the merged project. Meails, Mr Ails, Reverb, Reab were suggested. While I thought it was a joke, some people were really serious. Can you imagine if during the recent bailout, banks changed names every time they were purchased by another bank? People would be super confused and would not even know where to send their mortgage payments.\r\nOn top of that, Rails has a huge user base compared to Merb and has an immense brand recognition in the world at large, it would be foolish to throw that away.\r\n\r\nLet\'s not be chauvinistic and see what\'s best for all.\r\n<h2>You are killing innovation by killing the competition</h2>\r\nAgain, a good point but my question to you is: Should we stay in the competition just for the sake of it?\r\n\r\nRails clearly told us: we want what you have and we would love you to work with us. So the options were:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>tell them to go to hell and let them try to redo what we already did and know how to do.</li>\r\n	<li> accept to work with them and make Rails a better framework.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<em>Option 1</em> would keep the competition alive, but now you have 2 groups of people trying to do the same thing and being better at different aspects. The community gets confused and communication breaks.\r\n\r\n<em>Option 2</em>: we lose the Merb vs Rails competition, but we double the amount of people working on Rails and therefore increase the change to make it better faster.\r\n\r\nWe went for option 2 and we know there is already some competition out there and there will be more coming up soon. I don\'t think it\'s realistic to expect us not to merge because we want to keep the competition going.\r\n<h2>You screwed us over and now I have to go \"back\" to Rails</h2>\r\nYehuda will blog about some more detailed examples as we are making progress, but you need to stop thinking that Merb will just be absorbed into Rails.\r\nIf Rails just wanted to add some \"Merb flavor\" to Rails, they would have just taken whatever they needed and would not be interested in a merge.\r\nSee Rails 3.0 as a new generation of Rails, whatever we promised you for merb 2.0 plus all the goodies from Rails. Rails users will still have their default stack and all choices will be made for them (like in the current Merb stack). The difference for standard Rails user will be better performance, a static API and an option to go off the \"golden path\".\r\nMerbists won\'t lose the stuff they like in Merb, stacks, full support for DataMapper, Sequel and other ORMS, jQuery or other JS library, opt-in solution using just rails-core, better core isolation, built-in RSpec and webrat support, slices, merb-cache, merb-auth and all the other key plugins that will be ported over.\r\n\r\nTo be able to achieve all of that, we will have to make some infrastructure and code modifications.\r\n\r\nRails internals should end up:\r\n\r\n* way less magical (even Merb uses some magic, but we\'ll make sure to keep it to a minimum)\r\n* returning shorter and cleaner stack traces\r\n* cleaner (required for the new API)\r\n* better isolated (required to increase the modularity)\r\n* alias_method_chain won\'t be available at the public API level (we probably still will need some chaining mechanism internally, but that\'s a different story)\r\n\r\nSo, no, you don\'t have to go \"back\" to Rails. In fact, imagine you could do exactly what Rails does but with the performance and modular architecture of Merb. That\'s what you will get with Rails 3.0.\r\n<h2>Rails 3.0 won\'t even be as good as Merb 1.x</h2>\r\nI think I mainly replied to this question in my previous answer.\r\nThere is no reason why Rails 3.0 won\'t be better than Merb 1.x.Â  Actually, I believe our API will actually be even better. With the help of David, the existing Rails core team, and the Rails community, we will be able to define an awesome API that will change the way ruby web development will be done.\r\nThe merb API is great but we already know some of its limitations and we don\'t have as many plugin developers to work with. Working with plugin developers is something I\'m personally excited about. As a Rails developer I have been really frustrated when using 3rd party plugins and trying to develop my own.\r\nHaving a well tested, developed against, public API will make all the Rails 3.0 plugins so much better. And because Merb plugins already use an API, we will be able to port all the plugins over, so it will be at least as good as 1.x\r\nAlso, we are going to work on real app benchmark tests to make sure the performance gain is at least as good as what we have with Merb.\r\n\r\nMigration will be easy and well documented. We are not giving up on the Merb book and it will be very useful to explain the Merb way to new comers wanting an idea of the new stuff in Rails 3.0. It will also be the best source of information to migrate your app to Rails 3.0.\r\n\r\nTalking about migration, we promised to give you a sane migration path when it will be time to migrate.\r\nAgain, don\'t freak out because we are changing the name, the spirit of Merb will keep on living.\r\n<h2>The Rails team won\'t let you do what you have to do to merge Merb into Rails</h2>\r\nIn all honestly, I was worried about that. I was wondering if all of that was not an evil scam planned by DHH to kill Merb as it was getting a good momentum. I like conspiracy theories and it sounded pretty good.\r\nTo my surprised, after a few private conversations with David, I realized that he was genuinely interested in making Rails better for people and fulfill the needs of people who need more flexibility.\r\nJust re-read his blog post <a href=\"http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/23/merb-gets-merged-into-rails-3\">http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/23/merb-gets-merged-into-rails-3</a>. After what he said, how can he back up and just keep Rails the way it is? And why in the world would he want that to happen?\r\nIt\'s a team effort and we have already spent hours and hours discussing some details. I can promise you that the Rails team is very excited about the new stuff that\'s coming up. But don\'t forget that it\'s a merge and we are reconsidering some of the stuff we did in Merb to better re-implement them in Rails 3.0.\r\nSo far, I haven\'t seen any of the Rails core team member tell us, no you can\'t do that because that\'s not the way it\'s done in Rails or because we just don\'t like it.\r\n<h2>DHH is a jerk</h2>\r\nRecently, in an interview I gave to rubylearning.com <a href=\"http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/12/18/matt-aimonetti-why-on-earth-would-you-ignore-merb/\">http://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/12/18/matt-aimonetti-why-on-earth-would-you-ignore-merb/</a> I mentioned that a big difference between Merb and Rails was the way we were dealing with the user base.\r\nI quoted David from an Interview he gave to InfoQ <a href=\"http://www.infoq.com/interviews/David-Hansson\">http://www.infoq.com/interviews/David-Hansson</a> back in 2006.\r\n\r\nAs part of the merging evaluation process we literally spent hours talking back and forth. I had a seriously hard time believing that Rails and David honestly wanted to change their world views. How can you go from saying what you said in 2006 to adopting what Merb is pushing for: letting the framework bend to make what each developer wants if he doesn\'t want to follow the \"golden path\"?\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, David recently addressed this point on his blog. <a href=\"http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/36-work-on-what-you-use-and-share-the-rest\">http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/36-work-on-what-you-use-and-share-the-rest</a>\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to take a few minutes to address some concerns of the last 4%. The people who feel like this might not be such a good idea. And in particular, the people who feel like it might not be such a good idea because of various things that I\'ve said or done over the years.\"\r\n\r\nFirst thing first, David addresses the minority of people worried about his image and what it means for them.\r\nSo, David actually cares about hard core merbists and he wants them to join the fun. I personally see this as something very encouraging!\r\n\r\nA recurring theme we hear a lot is that Rails becomes whatever DHH/37signals needs/wants. If DHH needs something new, it will make it to Rails, if he doesn\'t need it, it won\'t.\r\n\r\nDavid has a very simple and almost shocking response: DHH != Rails\r\n\r\nDavid is really happy with Rails. Rails satisfies his needs but he knows that some people out there need/want something more/different.\r\n\r\n\"I personally use all of those default choices, so do many other Rails programmers. The vanilla ride is a great one and it\'ll remain a great one. But that doesn\'t mean it has to be the only one. There are lots of reasons why someone might want to use Data Mapper or Sequel instead of Active Record. I won\'t think of them any less because they do. In fact, I believe Rails should have open arms to such alternatives.\"\r\n\r\nSo, you can still think whatever you want about David. What\'s important is that Rails is more than David. It\'s an entire team of people with different needs and different views.\r\n\r\nDHH isn\'t a dictator and based on concrete examples such as the \"respond_to vs provides\" discussion, I can reassure you that David has been very receptive to arguments and never tried to force any decision because he thought it was better.','Merb/Rails merge, or Why should merbists be happy?',0,'','publish','open','open','','merb-rails-merge-or-why-should-merbists-be-happy','','http://yehudakatz.com/2008/12/23/rails-and-merb-merge/\nhttp://iamruinous.com/2008/12/23/why-merb-becoming-rails-3-is-a-good-thing/\nhttp://www.mr-eel.com/archives/158\nhttp://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/12/18/matt-aimonetti-why-on-earth-would-you-ignore-merb/\nhttp://rubylearning.com/blog/2008/12/18/matt-aimonetti-why-on-earth-would-you-ignore-merb/','2008-12-26 15:19:54','2008-12-26 23:19:54','',0,'http://merbist.com/?p=398',0,'post','',27),(412,1,'2008-12-29 13:57:38','2008-12-29 21:57:38','<a href=\"http://foysavas.com\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-414\" title=\"foy-savas\" src=\"http://merbist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/foy-savas-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"235\" /></a>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://foysavas.com\" target=\"_blank\">Foy Savas</a>, author or the \"<a href=\"http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780321601636\" target=\"_blank\">merb way</a>\" wrote a very well written <a href=\"http://www.foysavas.com/blog/2008/12/25/lets-be-clear-the-rails-monoculture-is-over.html\" target=\"_blank\">post on \"Rails monoculture\"</a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pat Eyler</a>, wrote an article asking if <a href=\"http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2008/12/rails-and-merb-better-together.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rails and Merb would be better together</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.geekmade.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Aldred</a>, tell people to <a href=\"http://www.geekmade.co.uk/2008/12/stop-worrying-and-start-loving-rails-3/\" target=\"_blank\">stop worrying and start loving Rails 3</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><span class=\"entry-content\"><a href=\"http://www.fotonauts.com/\" target=\"_blank\">fotonauts.com</a> a Rails and Merb Photo website developed by an ex-apple team, was <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/24/fotonauts-opens-up-a-little-more-skip-the-5000-long-waitlist/\" target=\"_blank\">featured in TechCrunch</a>.
